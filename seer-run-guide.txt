SEER BOT — SIMPLE INSTALL & RUN GUIDE (Windows, macOS, Linux)
Last updated: 2025-11-09

This guide is for non‑technical users. Follow it in order. If you get stuck, read the Troubleshooting section at the end.

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------
1) A Discord account.
2) A server where you have permission to invite a bot (you need the Manage Server permission).
3) A computer with internet access.

PART A — CREATE YOUR DISCORD BOT & TOKEN (ONE TIME)
---------------------------------------------------
1) Open https://discord.com/developers/applications and sign in.
2) Click "New Application". Name it something like "Seer". Accept the terms.
3) In the left sidebar, click "Bot", then "Add Bot" → "Yes, do it!".
4) Still on the Bot page:
   • Click "Reset Token" if you don’t see a token yet, then click "Copy" to copy your token.
     KEEP THIS SECRET. Anyone who has it can control your bot.
   • Turn ON the **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** (required). Also turn on **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** (optional).
   • (Optional) Upload an avatar image for your bot.

5) Invite the bot to your server:
   • Go to "OAuth2" → "URL Generator".
   • Under "Scopes" check:  bot, applications.commands
   • Under "Bot Permissions" check at least:
       - Read Messages/View Channels
       - Send Messages
       - Read Message History
       - Embed Links
       - Attach Files
       - Add Reactions
     (If you want the bot to delete its own helper messages, also add "Manage Messages").
   • Copy the generated URL at the bottom, paste it into your browser, and choose the server to invite the bot to.
   • After authorizing, the bot joins your server but will be offline until you run it on your computer (Part C).

PART B — INSTALL PYTHON (ONE TIME)
----------------------------------
You need Python 3.10 or newer.

Windows
  1) Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (choose the latest 3.x).
  2) Run the installer. IMPORTANT: check the box "Add Python to PATH". Then click "Install Now".

macOS
  Option A (simple): Download the latest 3.x macOS installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/
  Option B (Homebrew users): Open Terminal and run:  brew install python@3.12

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
  Open Terminal and run:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip

PART C — GET THE BOT FILES
---------------------------
Put the Seer bot folder somewhere easy (e.g., Desktop/seer). You should have files like:
  cogs/ (folder with combat.py, initiative.py, spells.py, etc.)
  data/ (items/spells/monsters lists)
  requirements.txt
  bot.py
  README.md, howto.txt

PART D — RUN THE BOT
--------------------
You will do these steps each time you want to start the bot. The first time includes a couple of one‑time steps.

1) Open a terminal in the bot folder.

   Windows
     • Press Windows key, type "PowerShell", open it.
     • Type:  cd "C:\\path\\to\\seer"   (example: cd "C:\\Users\\You\\Desktop\\seer")

   macOS / Linux
     • Open Terminal.
     • Type:  cd ~/path/to/seer   (example: cd ~/Desktop/seer)

2) (First time only) Create a virtual environment (keeps Seer’s libraries separate).
     python -m venv .venv

3) Activate the virtual environment.
   Windows (PowerShell):
     .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
     (If you get a policy error, run once:  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned)
   Windows (Command Prompt/cmd.exe):
     .venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
   macOS / Linux:
     source .venv/bin/activate

   Your prompt should now show (.venv). If not, try again.

4) (First time only) Install the bot’s libraries:
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install -r requirements.txt

5) Create a file named .env in the same folder as main.py with exactly this inside (replace the dots with your token):
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your-super-secret-token-here

   Save the file. (The file name is literally ".env" — on Windows Notepad you may need to choose "All Files (*.*)" in Save dialog.)

6) Start the bot:
     python main.py
   (If your entry file is named differently, use that filename instead.)

7) You should see the bot go ONLINE in your Discord server within a few seconds.
   In a text channel, type:  !help

   If you see a help listing, you’re good!

PART E — MAKE IT EASY TO START NEXT TIME (OPTIONAL)
---------------------------------------------------
Windows (double-click launcher)
  • Create a new text file in the bot folder named run-seer.bat and put this in it:
      @echo off
      call .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
      python main.py
      pause
  • Double-click run-seer.bat to start the bot. The window stays open so you can see logs.

macOS/Linux (simple script)
  • Create run-seer.sh with:
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      python main.py
  • Make it executable:  chmod +x run-seer.sh
  • Run it:  ./run-seer.sh

Linux (server-style, keeps running when you log out)
  • Use screen or tmux:
      sudo apt install -y screen
      screen -S seer
      source .venv/bin/activate && python main.py
      # detach with Ctrl+A then D; reattach later with: screen -r seer

FIRST STEPS INSIDE DISCORD
--------------------------
1) Create a channel like #seer-bot or #basic-fantasy.
2) In that channel type:  !help
3) Make your first character:
     !charcreate
     !char YourCharacterName
     !stats
4) Try a few utilities:
     !coins
     !bag
     !sb         (shows prepared spells and slot bubbles)
     !prepare Sleep
     !cast Sleep go1 -i   (simulate a cast without spending a slot)

WHERE THE BOT SAVES THINGS
--------------------------
• characters/  — contains your <name>.coe files (player characters). Back this up periodically.
• data/        — items, monsters, and rules lists. You normally don’t edit these unless you’re customizing.
• logs/        — (if present) text logs of runs.

UPDATING THE BOT
----------------
1) Stop the bot (Ctrl+C in the terminal window).
2) Replace the bot folder with the new version (or git pull if you used Git).
3) Activate the virtual environment again.
4) Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
5) Start it: python main.py

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Bot won’t show online
  • Check you used the correct token in .env (no spaces). If you pasted extra spaces/quotes, fix them.
  • In the Developer Portal, on the Bot page, click "Reset Token", copy the new token, update .env, restart.
  • Make sure you enabled "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT" on the Bot page.
  • Ensure your PC has internet and your firewall isn’t blocking Python.

I type !help and nothing happens
  • The bot needs permission to read and send messages in that channel (and to read message history).
  • Check the bot’s role permissions and the channel overrides.
  • If slash commands work but !help doesn’t: verify **Message Content Intent** is ON and restart the bot.
  • Make sure your server region/outage isn’t an issue (rare).

"pip is not recognized" (Windows)
  • Use: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

"ModuleNotFoundError" when starting
  • You skipped the "pip install -r requirements.txt" step or you installed outside the virtual env. Activate the env and install again.

"CommandNotFoundError" or "PermissionError" activating venv on Windows
  • Open PowerShell as Administrator once and run:
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
    Then close and reopen PowerShell and try activation again.

It says "You do not have permission to invite this bot"
  • You need the "Manage Server" permission on the Discord server to invite bots.
  • Ask an admin to either grant it to you temporarily or invite the bot for you.

I want the bot to keep running after I close the window
  • On Linux, use screen/tmux (see above) or set up a systemd service.
  • On Windows/macOS, leave the terminal open; for 24/7 hosting consider a VPS or a Raspberry Pi.

SAFETY & PRIVACY
----------------
• Keep your token secret. If you accidentally post it, immediately "Reset Token" in the Developer Portal and update your .env.
• Don’t run the bot as an Administrator.
• Back up your "characters/" folder if you care about your game data.

Happy adventuring!
