[AnimateDead]
cle = 4
mu = 5
range = 30
duration = special
desc = The casting of this spell causes the mortal remains of one or more deceased creatures to arise as animated skeletons or zombies. Such undead monsters persist until slain, and obey the verbal commands of the caster. A single casting of this spell may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice the caster's level of ability, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of members of player character races, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life.//The sort of monsters created depend on the condition of the remains. A reasonably intact corpse may only arise as a zombie, while similarly intact skeletal remains may only be animated as a skeleton. The caster chooses which remains are animated when casting the spell, in any case where there are more bodies than the caster can animate.//No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times their level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.//Usage: `!cast animatedead sk5 zo3` would summon 5 skeletons and 3 zombies.
fm = 5

[AnimateObjects]
cle = 6
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to animate objects that are normally inanimate, such that they may move and even appear to be alive. Objects to be animated may not be in the possession (worn or carried) of any creature, and must be non-magical in nature. The caster can animate one object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level (i.e. 300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so on).//Such objects are normally used to attack the enemies of the caster, and the GM must rule on their effectiveness in combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM's discretion). As a special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a moment rate of 10', and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM).
sp = 6

[Anti-MagicShell]
mu = 6
range = 10rad
duration = 1tlvl
desc = Within a 10' radius around the caster, all magic is negated for the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until the spell has expired.
cle = 7
fm = 6
nec = 6
sp = 6

[BladeBarrier]
cle = 6
range = 90
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell creates a barrier of flying, spinning, flashing blades. The caster may choose a barrier up to 20' high which extends up to 20' long per level of caster, or a ring-shaped barrier up to 20' high with a radius of up to 5' per each two full caster levels (so 30' at level 12 or 13, 35' at level 14 or 15, and so on).//Should any creature pass through the wall, it suffers 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a maximum damage of 15d6. A successful save vs. Death Ray reduces damage by half.//The caster may choose to conjure the wall in an area where creatures are already located; if this is done, all such creatures are harmed as if they passed through the wall, but a successful save vs. Death Ray in this case indicates that the creature has avoided all damage by jumping to one side or the other of the wall as chosen by the creature.//Any ranged attacks passing through a blade barrier suffer a penalty of -4 on the attack roll.
sp = 6

[Bless]
cle = 2
range = 50
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This spell gives the caster and their allies within a 50' radius a bonus of +1 on all attack rolls, morale checks (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws vs. any kind of magical fear. Casters of the 7th or higher level grant a bonus of +2 to attacks and saves vs. fear, but the morale bonus remains +1.
pa = 2

[Bane]
cle = 2
range = 50
duration = 1mlvl
desc = The reverse of bless is called bane. The caster's enemies within a 50' radius become fearful and uncertain, causing them to suffer a penalty of -1 on attack rolls, morale checks, and saving throws vs. any kind of magical fear. Casters of the 7th or higher level apply a penalty of -2 to attacks and saves vs. fear, but the morale penalty remains -1.
pa = 2

[CharmAnimal]
cle = 2
dru = 2
range = 60
duration = lplus1d4r
desc = This spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in much the same fashion as CharmPerson, at a rate of 1 hit die per caster level. The caster may decide which individual animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed, either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more fantastic nature (as determined by the GM) are allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals will resume normal activity immediately.//This spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animals; if combined with speak with animals, this spell becomes significantly more useful.
pa = 2

[CharmMonster]
mu = 4
range = 30
duration = special
desc = This spell has an effect similar to CharmPerson, but it is able to affect living creatures of any size or type. Undead monsters are unaffected, as are constructs such as golems and any creature which is functionally mindless (such as any kind of jelly). This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice of creatures 3 or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more than 3 hit dice. Saving throws are made just as for CharmPerson.
fm = 4
il = 4
mt = 4

[CharmPerson]
mu = 1
range = 30
duration = special
desc = This spell causes a humanoid (including all character races as well as creatures such as orcs, goblins, gnolls, and so on) of 4 hit dice or less to perceive the caster as a close friend, love interest, or at the very least as its trusted ally. Normal characters (PC or NPC) may be affected regardless of level of ability.//A save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If hostilities have already commenced or the target otherwise feels threatened by the caster, it receives a bonus of +5 on its saving throw.//The caster does not directly control the target; rather, orders must be given verbally, in writing, or by means of gestures. Obviously, verbal orders will only work if the target and caster share a spoken language, and the same limitation applies to written orders. Also note that the exact perception of the caster by the affected individual is not under the control of the caster; the GM should decide how the subject of this spell perceives its relationship to the caster.//Commands that go against the target's basic nature or ask it to attack its own allies or friends grant it a fresh saving throw with a bonus of +5 on the roll. Even if the target fails this save it may still choose to do something else when commanded to perform an unwanted action. Of course, if the caster, is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect its "friend" (though that could mean attacking its own allies, which might cause the target to instead attempt to carry off the  caster to a "safe" place).//The target receives a new saving throw each day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8 or less; the GM must rule on the equivalent intelligence of humanoid monsters.
fm = 1
il = 1
mt = 1

[Clairvoyance]
mu = 3
il = 3
range = 60
duration = 12t
desc = This spell enables the caster to see into another area through the eyes of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum 60' away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The creature may choose another subject creature after at least a turn (60 rounds) has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.
fm = 3
mt = 3

[Cloudkill]
mu = 5
il = 5
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 6rlvl
desc = This spell creates a 20'x20'x20' cloud of poison gas which moves at a rate of 10' per round under the control of the caster (so long as they concentrate on it). The gas outright kills any living creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it comes in contact with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice or levels must save vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.
fm = 5
mt = 5
nec = 5

[Commune]
cle = 5
range = self
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or an extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no question per caster level. The ritual to cast this spell takes 1 turn (60 rounds) to complete. The being contacted may or may not be omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or completely. These details are left to the GM's discretion.

[Confusion]
mu = 4
il = 4
range = 280
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 2rplus1lvl
desc = This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30' radius to become unable to think clearly, their actions thus becoming unpredictable. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the following table on each subject's Initiative number each round to see what the subject does://d10 - Behavior// 1 - Act normally.// 2 - Move toward the caster, and attack if possible.// 3-5 Take no action except possibly to babble.// 6-7 Move swiftly away from the caster.//8-10 Attack the nearest creature, regardless of whether it is a friend or foe.//If the target cannot perform the action indicated, the GM should move down the table (going back to the top if the table runs out) until an action is found that the target can perform. If a confused creature is attacked, it returns the attack on its next initiative number (later in this round or in the next round if it has already acted) regardless of what is rolled on the table.
fm = 4
mt = 4

[ConjureElemental]
mu = 5
range = 240
duration = special
desc = A portal to one of the Elemental Planes is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental from that plane. !info Elemental for further details regarding the types available and their statistics. At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in any given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on their Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only DispelMagic or DispelEvil will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not choose to remain on the material plane for long.
dru = 7
fm = 5
sp = 5

[ContinualLight]
cle = 3
mu = 2
il = 2
range = 360
duration = 1ylvl
desc = This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30' radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of 60'. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the Light spell, up to a maximum range of 360' from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.//As with Light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature's attack rolls if the saving throw fails.
fm = 2
mt = 2
nec = 2
sp = 2

[ContinualDarkness]
cle = 3
mu = 2
range = 360
duration = 1ylvl
desc = The reverse of ContinualLight causes complete absence of light in the area of effect (30' radius, with 60' radius dim light) in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. ContinualDarkness may be used to blind in the same way as ContinualLight.
fm = 2
il = 2
mt = 2
nec = 2
sp = 2

[CreateFood]
cle = 5
range = 10
duration = permanent
desc = This spell creates food sufficient to feed up to 3 men or one horse per caster level for one day. This food remains edible for just a day, but this can be extended by a day by casting PurifyFoodandWater on it (and this can be done repeatedly, keeping the food good indefinitely). Food created by this spell is nourishing and satisfying, but is rather bland.

[CreateWater]
cle = 4
range = 10
duration = permanent
desc = This spell creates one gallon of clean water per caster level. One or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.
dru = 1

[CureBlindness]
cle = 3
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = With this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including Light or ContinualLight). Blindness caused by a curse cannot be cursed by this spell.

[CauseBlindness]
cle = 3
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = Reversed, CureBlindness becomes CauseBlindness, which causes a living creature touched to become blind. A successful melee attack roll is required to touch the victim, and no Saving Throw is allowed. Blinded creatures are surprised on a 1-4 on 1d6, suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls and to AC, and a -2 penalty to its Initiative rolls.

[CureDisease]
cle = 3
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = Cure disease cures all diseases and kills all parasites afflicting the target creature. A magical or otherwise special disease (as defined by the GM) may be unaffected by this spell, or may require a caster of a certain minimum level to cure it. Also note, just because a disease or parasite is removed does not mean that the victim cannot be infected anew should that affliction be encountered again.
dru = 3
nec = 4

[CauseDisease]
cle = 3
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = The reverse form of CureDisease causes a living creature touched by the caster to suffer from a debilitating and potentially deadly disease for the next 1d10 days. A successful melee attack roll is required to touch the victim, and no Saving Throw is allowed. The target suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls, Armor Class and Saving Throws. While the victim is sick they cannot benefit from natural healing of damage or Constitution point losses, nor prepare spells or move at running speed.//At the end of each day in which an infected character performed any form of exertion (for example by fighting, traveling, working, or doing magical research), the character must roll a saving throw vs. Spells or suffer 1d6 points of damage. Once the spell duration has elapsed the affected character, if still alive, is free of the illness and can start healing damage and recovering lost Constitution points, and can again prepare spells.
dru = 3
nec = 4

[CureLightWounds]
cle = 1
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = With this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 hit points of damage by laying their hand upon the injured creature. Undead are injured by CureLightWounds.
dru = 1
pa = 1

[CauseLightWounds]
cle = 1
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = The reverse of CureLightWounds causes 1d6+1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll is required in this case, and the spell is wasted if the attack roll fails. Undead are healed by CauseLightWounds.
dru = 1
pa = 1

[CureSeriousWounds]
cle = 4
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell works exactly like CureLightWounds, save that it heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 per caster level.
dru = 4

[CauseSeriousWounds]
cle = 4
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell works exactly like CauseLightWounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 points of damage, +1 per caster level.
dru = 4

[Darkvision]
mu = 3
il = 3
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = The subject receives Darkvision with a range of 60' for the duration of the spell.
fm = 3
mt = 3
nec = 3

[DeathSpell]
mu = 6
range = 240
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a 30' radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more hit dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other "creature" that is not truly alive.
fm = 6
nec = 6

[DetectEvil]
cle = 1
mu = 2
range = 60
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even "bad" characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the "evil" creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.//The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not "evil," and are thus not detectable by this spell.
fm = 2
pa = 1

[DetectGood]
cle = 1
mu = 2
range = 60
duration = 1rlvl
desc = The reverse of DetectEvil works exactly like DetectEvil, however with respect to detecting "good" enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.
fm = 2
pa = 1

[DetectInvisible]
mu = 2
il = 1
range = 60
duration = 1tlvl
desc = By means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible characters, creatures or objects within the given range, seeing them as bright transparent outlines or shapes.
fm = 2
nec = 2
mt = 1

[DetectMagic]
cle = 1
mu = 1
il = 2
range = 60
duration = 2t
desc = The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of -2.
dru = 1
fm = 1
mt = 2
nec = 1
sp = 1
pa = 1

[DimensionDoor]
mu = 4
range = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster of this spell and any single target creature within range is transported instantly, to any location within 200 feet plus 20 feet per caster level. The caster may give distance and direction or may choose to visualize the target location, and the target will be transported unerringly to that place. An unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being transproted. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target creature will be transported also, including another character or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area is within a solid object, the spells fails automatically.
fm = 4
il = 4
mt = 4
nec = 4
sp = 4

[Disintegrate]
mu = 6
range = 60
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell projects a green laser-like beam of light from the caster's pointing fingertip. Any single creature or object (up to a 10x10x10 foot cube of material) will be completely disintegrated. The target is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. This spell can target just one creature per casting, so if the target makes its save the spell is wasted.//Equipment worn or carried by a disintegrated creatures is not affected, and will naturally fall to the floor as if dropped.
fm = 6
nec = 6
sp = 6

[DispelEvil]
cle = 5
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures from the nether planes, hereafter called "evil creatures."//First, the caster's Armor Class is improved by 4 points when attacked by evil creatures; this effect lasts until the spell ends, whether by expiration of the duration or through the employment of one of the following effects.//With a successful attack roll the caster can drive an evil creature back to the nether planes; the caster must of course be engaged with the creature (i.e. in melee range). The creature may make a save vs. Spells to resist. Any successful attack roll by the caster for this purpose ends the spell's effects, whether or not the creature saves.//Alternately, by touching the affected creature, item, or area, the caster can immediately dispel any one spell or similar magical effect cast by the evil creature. There is no roll for this effect, except if the target is an unwilling creature in which case an attack roll is needed to actually touch it. The only spells which cannot be ended this way are those which are immune to DispelMagic. Successfully performing the touch ends the spell, regardless of whether or not any evil magic is actually ended.

[DispelMagic]
cle = 4
mu = 3
il = 4
range = 120
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell can be used to end ongoing spells or similar magical effects cast on a creature or object, or to end such effects within a cubic area 20' on a side. The caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.//If DispelMagic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster level equal or less than the DispelMagic caster's level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level caster might not be canceled; there is a 5 percent chance the DispelMagic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20 percent chance of failure.//Some spells cannot be ended by DispelMagic; this specifically includes any curse, including those created by BestowCurse as well as by cursed items.

[Feeblemind]
mu = 5
il = 5
range = 180
duration = permanent
desc = This spell allows the caster to inflict a terrible curse on a living creature, reducing both Intelligence and Charisma to just 1 point each. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist this effect, but if the target creature is a spellcaster a penalty of -4 is applied to the saving throw.//Once feebleminded, the victim of this spell can no longer cast spells, speak or understand any language, or indeed communicate at all as their mind can no longer understand even such simple things as pointing or beckoning. The victim still knows their friends and allies and will follow them and try to help or protect them.//This effect can be removed by a Heal spell, or with the reversed form of this spell Restoremind.
fm = 5

[Restoremind]
mu = 5
range = 180

desc = This spell allows a caster to remove the Feeblemind effect that has been cast on a target.
fm = 5
il = 5
mt = 5

[FindTraps]
cle = 2
range = 30
duration = 3t
desc = This spell permits the caster to detect a varity of traps, both mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30' of a trap, they will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhold, or unsafe walls of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about its type or nature.
dru = 2
sp = 2
pa = 2

[FindthePath]
cle = 6
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell grants the caster, or another subject the caster touches, the ability to find the best and shortest route to a destination selected by the caster. The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of the location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.//This spell works as well indoors or even underground as it does in the outdoors. However, FindthePath works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. It can only lead someone to a destination that is on the same plane of existence as the caster when cast; this can be very limiting of the caster (and subject if any) is in a closed or pocket universe of some kind.//The subject can sense the approximate direction of the destination, but also knows the best path to get there, sensing each turning and knowing which paths or corridors to follow when choices appear (but not sooner, unfortunately). The spell even overcomes things such as secret doors, which the subject will sense and know how to open, and grants the knowledge of passwords or codes at the correct moments.//Note that the spell will always choose the best path. For example, if the shortest way requires the use of a key which the subject does not have, the spell will choose a different, probably longer way if possible. If this is not possible, the subject will be led to the locked door and will understand that they must find a way to pass through on their own.//The spell ends when the subject arrives at the destination or when the duration expires, whichever comes first. If the duration expires before arrival, the subject may still remember the approximate direction to the destination but will no longer know the way.
dru = 6

[Fireball]
mu = 3
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = Casting this spell causes a tiny glowing ember about the size of a pea to fly forth from the caster's pointer finger, by which the direction of flight is indicated. The ember flies as fast as an arrow and explodes into flames filling a 20' radius sphere when it reaches a distance chosen by the caster (up to its maximum range), or sooner if it impacts any solid or liquid surface. Those within the area of the flames suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a saving throw vs. Spells allowed for half damage.//No roll is normally required when casting this spell, but if the caster wishes to project the ember through a slit or other small opening they must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit it; failure indicates the fireball hits an adjacent surface and detonates there.//Combustible objects or substances within the area of effect will generally catch fire and possibly be destroyed (as determined by the GM). Metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the flames do not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).//While the fireball exerts little if any force or pressure when exploding, it may still destroy weak or flammable barriers; if such a thing happens (in the determination of the GM, of course) the fireball completes its expansion in the space beyond the destroyed barrier.
fm = 3

[FleshToStone]
mu = 6
rngeperlvl = 30
duration = permanent
desc = This spell causes a living creature, along with all gear it wears or carries, to be petrified. This is the same effect caused by the gaze of a medusa or the touch of a cockatrice. A saving through vs. Petrification is allowed to resist the spell.//The petrified victim becomes dormant; its mind cannot be contacted in any way, and it is neither properly alive nor dead. Damage inflicted on its statue-like form will apply to its fleshy form if it is ever restored; simply breaking off an arm or leg is probably enough to result in death due to blood loss. The GM should determine the effects of any such injury.
fm = 6
sp = 6

[StoneToFlesh]
mu = 6
rngeperlvl = 30
duration = permanent
desc = The reverse of FleshToStone acts as a counterspell for it, restoring the creature just as it was when it was petrified. The spell does nothing if applied to ordinary stone which is not the result of FleshToStone or a similar petrification effect.
fm = 6
sp = 6

[FloatingDisc]
mu = 1
range = 0
duration = 5tplus1lvl
desc = The casting of this spell causes an invisible platform of magical force to appear. It is about the size of a shield, about 3 feet in diameter and an inch deep at its center. It can support a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.)//The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster's waist. It remains still when within 10' of the caster, and follows at the caster's movement rate if they move away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10 feet from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to the surface beneath.//The disc must be loaded so that items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over 62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc. Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes; but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain stable.
fm = 1
nec = 1
sp = 1

[Fly]
mu = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The subject of this spell can fly at a spell equal to their normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The subject can ascend at half their movement rate and descend at twice normal movement rate, with the same maneuverability as the subject had while moving on the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires no more concentration than walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither charge nor run, nor carry more weight than their normal maximum load.//If the spell duration expires while the subject is still airborn, the magic fails slowly such that the subject descends at a rate of 120 feet per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in that time they land safely; if not, the subject falls the rest of the distance and suffers normal falling damage. However, if this spell is ended by DispelMagic or similar outside forces, the subject falls immediately.
fm = 3

[Geas]
mu = 6
rngeperlvl = 5
duration = special
desc = By means of this spell the caster compels a living creature to perform some specific action or services, or alternately to avoid performing some action. The target creature must be able to hear and understand the caster, or it cannot be affected. This spell will automatically fail if used to compel a creature to engage in some obviously self-destructive action.//A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with the caster for some service. Once subjected to this spell the subject must obey the instructions given by the caster indefinitely, though if the geas is to perform some action the spell effectively ends when that action has been completed.//For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a penalty of -2 to each of its ability scores, up to a maximum penalty of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. If the subject resumes obeying the geas, all such penalties are removed after 24 hours.//If the task assigned to the subject of this spell is open-ended or otherwise unable to be completed, the subject is still compelled to try to perform the task, but the will will end in no more than one day per caster level.//Very clever creatures may be able to subvert the instructions given; the GM must decide on the results of any such attempts.//This spell (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a RemoveCurse spell from a caster of a higher level than the caster of the Geas, or by a Wish, or by the reverse of this spell. DispelMagic does not affect a Geas spell.
fm = 6
il = 6
mt = 6

[GrowthofAnimals]
cle = 3
range = 60
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell causes an animal to grow to double its normal size and eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal's carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicky afterward (at the GM's discretion.)//This spell does not give the caster control of the animal. Gear worn or carried by the animal are also enlarged but not altered in any other way. If removed from the creature such items resume normal size instantly. Any magical properties of enlarged items are not changed.
dru = 5

[GrowthofPlants]
mu = 4
range = 120
duration = permanent
desc = This spell causes normal vegetation of any sort within range to become thick and overgrown. The area of effect is determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1,000 square feet (a 10'x100' area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants become densely entangled, and characters or creatures wishing to move through must hack or force their way through it. All movement within the affected area is reduce to no more than 5' per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate.//This spell cannot take effect in an area that does not already have some plants present. Any sort of animated plant creature affected by this spell is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist, but if this save fails it is affected as GrowthofAnimals.//This spell is permanent until countered, either by ShrinkPlants or DispelMagic.
fm = 4

[ShrinkPlants]
mu = 4
range = 120
duration = permanent
desc = The reverse of GrowthofPlants may be used to render overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal version. Animated plant creatures are normally unaffected by this spell, but if such creatures have already been enlarged by GrowthofPlants this spell will reverse the effect. In the latter case, a saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist.//This spell is permanent until countered, either by GrowthofPlants or DispelMagic.
dru = 5
fm = 4

[HallucinatoryTerrain]
mu = 4
il = 4
range = 400
rngeperlvl = 40
duration = 12tlvl
desc = This spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain appear to be a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the like). This spell requires a full turn (60 rounds) to cast.//The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another type of normal terrain. The magic does not affect creatures nor any sort of fabricated item; such things retain their appearance and visibility. A save vs. Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters viewing the area actively attempt to do so.
fm = 4
mt = 4
sp = 4

[Haste]
mu = 3
range = 30
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster level. The affected creatures move and act twice as fast as normal, having double their normal movement rates and making twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple haste or speed effects don't combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.//In combat, the subject of this spell performs two full rounds of actions on their turn.
fm = 3
sp = 3

[Slow]
mu = 3
range = 30
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = The reverse of Haste is Slow; affected creatures move at half speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round) and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target creatures may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and Slow counter and dispel each other.
fm = 3
sp = 3

[Heal]
cle = 6
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = This spell enables the caster to almost totally cure wounds, diseases, and other afflictions of a single living creature. With a touch the caster cures blindness, deafness, confusion, disease, feeblemind, choking, nausea, and poison. All but 1d4 hit points are restored to the subject, if it has any injuries. Ability point losses are fully restored, if and only if those losses would be recoverable without this spell; permanent losses to ability scores are not recovered. Energy drain is also not affected by this spell.//Heal only affects living creatures. If applied to an undead creature, the effects are reversed such that Heal becomes Harm and vice versa.

[Harm]
cle = 6
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = The reverse of Heal, Harm, injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, they will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which Harm may kill a creature).//Harm only affects living creatures. If applied to an undead creature, the effects are reversed such as that Harm becomes Heal and vice versa.

[HoldMonster]
mu = 5
range = 180
duration = 2d8t
desc = This spell functions like HoldPerson, except that it affects any living creature that fails its save vs. Spells.
cle = 4
fm = 5
il = 6
mt = 6

[HoldPerson]
cle = 2
mu = 3
il = 4
range = 180
duration = 2d8t
desc = This spell will render any living (not undead) humanoid creature (as defined in CharmPerson) paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are conscious and able to breathe, but cannot move, act, or speak in any way. A successful save vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes their save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.//A paralyzed swimmer can't swim and may drown. A character who has somehow gained wings and is then paralyzed while airborne will not be able to move its wings to fly and will thus fall.
fm = 3
mt = 4
pa = 2

[HoldPortal]
mu = 1
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell secures a portal such as a door, gate, window, or shutter made of normal non-magical building materials; the portal behaves as if securely locked for the duration of the spell. The door may be opened early only by means of Knock or a successful casting of DispelMagic, or by literally destroying the door (which may well require more time than the duration of this spell allows).
fm = 1
nec = 1
sp = 1

[IceStorm]
mu = 4
range = 300
rngeperlvl = 30
duration = 1r
desc = This spell causes a powerful storm of sleet and hail to fall in a 20' radius around the target spot for a full round. This effect causes 5d6 points of damage to every creature within the area, with a save vs. Spells allowed to reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical volume of 40', so creatures higher than that distance below the target spot are unaffected. Any creature naturally resistant to cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes the saves).//Visibility within the storm is very poor, such that most creatures will attack with a penalty of -2 on the attack roll. Walking movement is reduced to half speed, and running is not possible within the storm; anyone who tries will fall down and be forced to remain on the ground until the spell ends. Flying is likewise impossible, and any flying creature within the area will be driven to the ground. A penalty of -20 percent is applied to any Listen rolls made by those in the storm's area.//When the spell ends, the hail and ice deposited by the storm disappears as if it had never existed.
fm = 4

[InsectPlague]
cle = 5
range = 300
rngeperlvl = 30
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels, with a maximum of 6 swarms. An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit. In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes, though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10' squares.//Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature having less than AC 15 is considered unarmored).//Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to "ward off" the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case damage is likewise reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 points of damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a Sleep spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from any victims due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round.//All swarms summoned by this spell must be contiguous with each other such that they effectively form a single huge swarm, though the caster may stretch them out in a line, form them into a block, or indeed arrange them in some serpentine form if desired.//The summoned swarms persist for the duration below, or until they are slain, whichever comes first. The caster may summon them in areas where creatures are already located. Once summoned, the swarms are stationary until they disappear or are slain, and they attack any creatures who are within their area.
dru = 4
nec = 5

[Invisibility]
mu = 2
il = 2
range = touch
duration = special
desc = This spell causes the creature touched (who may be the caster) to become invisible, undetectable by normal vison or Darkvision. Invisible creatures may be detected by those with non-visual sensory abilities.//All items worn or carried by the target when the spell is cast become invisible as well. If the target lays down an invisible item, it instantly becomes visible again; on the other hand, items picked up do not automatically become invisible. If the target places a visible item entirely inside its invisible clothing, backpack, pouch, or other container so that if the target were visible the item could not be seen, it will become invisible just as if it were held when the spell was cast.//Note that casting this spell upon another makes the target invisible to the caster as well as everyone else. A party of invisible characters will likely experience problems with running into or tripping over each other.//The spell lasts at most 24 hours if not ended sooner. It ends instantly if the target attacks an opponent or casts any spell. Other actions do not normally end the spell. The target may end the spell at will.//Objects that shed light may be made invisible but the light itself will remain visible, and the source of that light (and the character carrying it) can thus be discovered. Rain, dust, paint, and any other visible substance thrown or applied to an invisible creature will also render it detectable.
fm = 2
mt = 2
nec = 2

[Invisible10]
mu = 3
il = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The target of this spell becomes invisible just as with Invisibility, but in addition all other creatures within 10 feet of the target at the time of casting (referred to as members of the group) also become invisible. Unlike with normal invisibility, all members can see each other and themselves normally.//If any member negates the effect by attacking or casting a spell, they become visible but all other members remain invisible. However, if the original subject takes an action that negates the invisibility, it ends for the entire group. If a member negates their own invisibility, that member will no longer be able to see the still-invisible group members. Moving further than 10 feet from the target also causes a group member to become visible; returning to the area does not reinstate the invisibility.
fm = 3
mt = 3

[InvisibleStalker]
mu = 6
il = 6
range = 0
duration = special
desc = The caster summons an invisible stalker to do their bidding. The spell persists until DispelEvil is cast on the creature, it is slain, or the task is fulfilled. The GM is advised to review the monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is used, as they may not always perform reliably.
fm = 6
mt = 6

[Knock]
mu = 2
range = 30
duration = special
desc = This spell can undo a single means of securing a door, chest, or shackle. It negates HoldPortal, dispelling it; a WizardLock spell is deactivated for 1 turn (60 rounds) but is not dispelled. A lock can be opened, a stuck door forced, a door barred or bolted can be unbarred or unbolted. These effects do not automatically restore themselves, except for the WizardLock. Knock cannot raise a portcullis or open any other portal which requires a mechanism to open (such as a winch for example).//Each casting undoes a single method of securing the door or item, so that for example a door which is both locked and stuck can be unlocked but will still be stuck; a second casting of Knock will open such a door.
fm = 2
nec = 2
sp = 2

[Levitate]
mu = 2
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = When this spell is casting, the caster or any one creature or object they touch begins to levitate. Levitation allows the caster to cause the subject to rise or fall at a rate of as much as 20 feet per round.//If the target creature is unwilling, the caster must roll a successful attack roll in order to touch the target, and even if this roll succeeds the target is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the magic. Likewise, if the target is an object being held by an unwilling creature, a similar attack roll and saving throw will be required. Unattended objects are automatically affected when touched.//The caster controls the levitating subject mentally. If the caster ceases to control the subject, it remains at its current altitude until the spell ends, at which point it falls.//Levitation does not provide any means of horizontal movement, but neither is the levitated subject fixed in place. It can be moved by pushing or by towing with a rope, for exmaple. A creature being levitated can pull itself along a cliff face or across a ceiling, or pull itself with a rope fixed to a solid object. Movement of this sort is usually at half normal walking speed. The subject cannot, however, change its own altitude.//If a levitating creature attempts to attack with most weapons it will find that it is unstable. The first such attack is made at a penalty of -1 on the attack roll, and this penalty worsens by an additional -1 each round to a maximum penalty of -5. Should the creature refrain from making an attack for a full round, it is reduced to the -1 penalty on  the next round. This does not usually affect spellcasting while levitated, however.
fm = 2
sp = 2

[Light]
cle = 1
mu = 1
il = 1
range = 120
duration = 6tplus1lvl
desc = This spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30' radius area well (with dim light extending for an additional 20') around the target location or object. This effect is stationary when cast in an area, but it can be cast on a movable object or even onto a character or creature.//When a Light spell overlaps with a Darkness spell, they cancel out, leaving only normal illumination in the overlapping area.//A Light spell may be cast to dispel the Darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa), leaving neither spell active.//Either Light or Darkness may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target's eyes. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made the spell does not take effect at all. A Light or Darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim.)

fm = 1
mt = 1
nec = 1
sp = 1
pa = 1

[Darkness]
cle = 1
mu = 1
range = 120
duration = 6tplus1lvl
desc = The reverse of Light is Darkness, creating an area of darkness as described in Light. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.//When a Light spell overlaps with a Darkness spell, they cancel out, leaving only normal illumination in the overlapping area.//A Darkness spell may be cast to dispel the Light spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa), leaving neither spell active.//Either Light or Darkness may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target's eyes. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made the spell does not take effect at all.

[LightningBolt]
mu = 3
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = Casting this spell causes a bright thin spark about the thickness of a string to fly forth from the caster's pointing finger, which indicates the direction. The spark stretches as fast as an arrow's flight until it reaches the caster's chosen distance (up to maximum range) or strikes a solid or liquid surface, at which point it explodes into a full-fledged bolt of lightning extending another 60 feet further. The lightning bolt passes through an area 5 feet wide, arcing and jumping, so that while it is not actually 5 feet wide, for game purposes it is treated as if it were.//Those within the area of the lightning bolt suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a saving throw vs. Spells allowed for half damage.//If a lightning bolt is targeted at a body of water it explodes at the point of impact, as described above, but within the water volume struck it expands like a Fireball to a maximum radius of 20 feet instead of performing as it does in the air. If a lightning bolt is cast underwater it explodes in the same way, but at the tip of the caster's outstretched finger.//The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can damage metals with a low melting point; metals such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the lightning does not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).//If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the GM's option. Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.
fm = 3

[LocateObject]
cle = 3
mu = 2
range = 360
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell grants the caster knowledge of the location of an object. The caster must know the object well or be able to clearly imagine it. (Viewing an accurate drawing or painting will suffice for the latter option.) A general item can be located; if more than one such item is in range, the spell will lead the caster to the nearest one.//Unique or unusual items can only be located if the caster has first-hand knowledge (not merely through divination such as Clairvoyance or a crystal ball). The spell cannot be used to locate creatures of any sort. A layer of lead or gold no thicker than foil surrounding the item will prevent it from being located.
fm = 2
nec = 2
sp = 2

[LowerWater]
mu = 6
rngeperlvl = 20
duration = 1tlvl
desc = Using this spell the caster lowers the level of the water in a river, a lake, or even the sea by up to 2 feet per caster level for the given duration, but to no less than 1 inch deep. The spell affects an area with radius of at most 10 feet per level centered on the caster's chosen location (within the range given).//There will be a steep slope up to the surface of any area of un-lowered water that falls outside the spell's radius. Ships which were already in the area of effect as well as any that dare to enter it will be unable to climb the slope and thus unable to leave the area (if not outright beached by the spell in the first place).//This spell has the effect of Slow when cast upon water elementals and other creatures formed from water; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the effect. It cannot be cast upon any other kind of creatures.

[MagicJar]
mu = 5
range = 60
duration = special
desc = This spell allows the caster to attempt to possess the body of another living creature. The caster begins by placing their spirit into a gem, jewel, or large crystal of some sort within the spell range, called the magic jar. The caster needs to know where the magic jar is located, but does not have to be able to see it. While the caster's spirit is outside their body, that body appears to all intents and purposes to be dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would.//Each round after entering the magic jar the caster's spirit can attempt to take control of the body of a living creature within the spell range; the target is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. If the saving throw fails, the spirit of the target (now called the host) is trapped in the magic jar and the caster's spirit takes possession of the host's body. Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by ProtectionFromEvil or a similar ward.//If the attempt to possess a victim fails, the caster's spirit remains in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell. The caster may make an attempt to possess another target on the following round, if desired.//If on the other hand the possession attempt is successful, the caster may remain in control of the host's body for as long as desired. The caster's spirit may return to the magic jar at any time when it is within spell range, restoring the host's spirit to its own body. The caster may not return to the same host's body again for the remainder of the duration of this spell, but may attempt to possess it again on a subsequent casting.//Whenever the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, it may choose to return to its own body if it is within spell range. If the body is not in range, the caster's spirit may become trapped if no vulnerable creatures are in range.//Whenever the caster's spirit returns to their own body, the spell ends. There is a 50 percent change that the magic jar will shatter when the spell ends (if the spell did not end because it was broken), becoming worthless and unusable.//When the caster's spirit possesses a host, the caster has access to the physical abilities of the host's body, including Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, while still retaining their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The caster has access only to their own knowledge, class and level, attack bonus, saving throws, spell casting ability, and any other purely mental capabilities.//The caster does not gain access to supernatural or otherwise extraordinary powers of the host, and may not be able to perform physical actions that the caster has never done before (such as flying). The caster does not have access to the host's sensory capabilities, such as Darkvision, the enhanced sense of smell of a dog, and so on.//If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by DispelMagic or physically), the caster's spirit will return to its own body if it is in spell range; if not, the caster's spirit departs and the caster dies. In either case, the spell ends.//If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by DispelEvil, and the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster's spirit returns to the jar and the host's spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster and the host both die.//If the host's spirit is in range of the magic jar, and the jar is broken while in spell range of the host's body, the caster dies, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. If the jar is broken while out of the host's body, the host dies and the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. DispelEvil can still be used to drive the caster's spirit from the body, ending the spell. A stranded caster may use another casting of this spell (with another magic jar) to return to their own body, which kills the host's body.

[MagicMissile]
mu = 1
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell causes a magical arrow of energy to fly from the caster's finger and unerringly hit its target, inflicting 1d6+1 points of damage. The target must be at least partially visible to the caster, and no saving throw is normally allowed. It's not possible to target a specific part of the target. Inanimate objects are not affected by this spell.//For every three caster levels beyond 1st, an additional missile is fired: two at 4th level, three at 7th, four at 10th, and the maximum of five missiles at 13th level or higher. When multiple missiles are fired in this way, the caster can target one or several creatures as desired, as long as all are visible to the caster at the same time. All such targets must be designated before any damage is rolled.
fm = 1
sp = 1

[MagicMouth]
mu = 1
il = 1
range = 30
duration = special
desc = This spell places a simple form of programmed illusion on a non-living object within range. When triggered, the spell causes the illusion of a mouth to appear on the object and a message to be said aloud. The enchantment can remain in place indefinitely, but is expended when triggered (i.e. the message is normally delivered only once).//The message recounted may be up to three words per caster level in length. The caster may insert pauses in the message, but the entire message must be delivered in a time period of no more than a turn (60 rounds). The voice of the spell can be made to speak at any volume attainable by a normal human. It will sound enough like the caster's own voice to be recognized by a close associate of the caster, but not identical.//The illusionary mouth moves as if actually speaking the message being delivered, and remains visible during pauses. If placed on an artistic depiction of a creature with a mouth (such as a painting or statue), the spell can be made to appear to animate the mouth of the object.//This spell cannot be used to activate magic items which have command words, nor to activate any other magical effects.//The caster must choose the conditions under which this spell is triggered. The conditions may be as complicated or as simple as desired, but must depend only on sight and hearing; the spell has no other sensory capabilities. he spell also has no particular intelligence, and can be fooled by disguises or illusions. The spell does have the capability to effectively see in normal darkness, but not in any sort of magical darkness, and it cannot detect invisible creatures nor see through doors, walls, or even opaque curtains. Likewise, stealth or magical silence are effective in preventing audible triggers. Finally, the spell cannot detect a character's class, level, ability scores, or any other feature not obvious to a normal NPC.//Triggers have an effective sensory range of 10 feet per caster level; sounds, sights, or actions outside that range will never trigger the spell.
fm = 1
mt = 1

[Massmorph]
mu = 4
il = 4
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1hlvl
desc = With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller) creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern, etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120' radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may choose to be included among the affected creatures.//Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing through the area for so long as they remain still. If an affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if they wish by speaking a single word. The illusion can also be ended by DispelMagic.
fm = 4
mt = 4

[MindReading]
mu = 2
il = 2
mt = 2
range = 60
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell, sometimes called ESP, permits the caster to hear (and possibly see, if the target visualizes anything) the surface thoughts of one or more living creatures within range. The caster must designate a direction or select a visible target, and then concentrate for a turn (60 rounds) in order to "hear" the thoughts. Each turn the caster may choose to "listen" in a different direction. The caster may stop listening, then resume again later, so long as the duration has not expired. The target creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way, though any creature already under the effect of this spell or any similar form of telepathy will instantly know and be able to sense the direction of the caster.//Rock more than 2 inches thick or even a very thin covering of lead or gold will block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this effect, as are mindless creatures and constructs such as golems.
fm = 2

[MirrorImage]
mu = 2
il = 1
range = self
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to create multiple illusory duplicates (called figments) which seem to swirl and move around and through each other as well as the caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is the real one. A total of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created.//The figments mimic the caster's actions, going through the motions of casting spells, drinking potions, levitating, and so on, just as the caster does. Figments always look exactly like the caster.//Any opponent who attacks or casts spells directly on the caster will always hit a figment instead. Attacking a figment destroys it, whether or not the attack roll is successful, as does any attack spell directed at one. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a Fireball, all figments will be destroyed and the caster will be injured by the spell.
fm = 2
mt = 1

[NeutralizePoison]
cle = 4
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell neutralizes any poison or venom in the creature or object touched. A creature suffering from poison or venom suffers no further effects from it.//If cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.
dru = 3
sp = 4

[PoisonTouch]
cle = 4
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster must make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must save vs. Poison or die. The caster's touch remains poisonous for 1 round per caster level, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the spell).
dru = 3
sp = 4

[Passwall]
mu = 5
range = 30
duration = 3t
desc = Passwall creates a temporary breach or passageway through walls of wood, plaster, or stone; metal walls cannot be affected by this spell. This breach is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet per three caster levels above 9th (20 feet at 12th, 30 feet at 15th, 40 feet at 18th). If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, DispelMagic, or caster's choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.
fm = 5
nec = 5
sp = 5

[PhantasmalForce]
mu = 2
il = 2
range = 180
duration = concentration
desc = With this spell the caster visualizes and projects the illusion of an object, creature (or small group of creatures), or other effect. The caster can project an illusion up to a maximum size of 20'x20'x20'. The illusion is purely visual, with no other sensory features. The image is not static, but can be animated as the caster desires so long as all images remain within the area of effect. The illusion persists so long as the caster concentrates on it.//If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in combat. Damage done by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real; those "killed" or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up uninjured (at least by this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will be equal to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.//Projecting images of more creatures than the caster's level grants viewers with at least average Intelligence an immediate save vs. Spells to recognize the creatures as illusions; those making the save will be unaffected by any actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A similar save may be grants by the GM any time they feel the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.
fm = 2
mt = 2

[PolymorphOther]
mu = 4
range = 30
duration = permanent
desc = This spell allows the caster to change one living creature which is not incorporeal or gaseous into another form of living creature. The assumed form can't have more hit dice than the caster's level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike PolymorphSelf, the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not remember its former life.//The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. A creature with the ability to transform or change shape such as a doppelganger is changed, but can assume a different form after a single round.//Equipment worn or carried will be dropped if the new form is unable to wear or carry the items. If any such item would be constricting or physically harmful to the new form, the transformation slows and alters such that they are dropped without damage to the items nor harm to the target creature. If the GM determines that any items cannot be removed in this way, they must decide on the exact results.//Unwilling targets which successfully save vs. Paralysis are not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the creature is slain, at which time the target resumes its original form.
fm = 4

[PolymorphSelf]
mu = 4
range = self
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to change into a different form of living creature. The form assumed may not have more hit dice than the caster has levels, nor be incorporeal or gaseous.//The caster assumes the physical nature of the assumed form while retaining their mental and spiritual characteristics. They gain the Armor Class and all physical attacks possessed by the form but do not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities. Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the caster to assume the form of a dragon they could use the dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the dragon's breath.//If the form assumed is capable of speaking and making appropriate gestures (as determined by the GM) the caster may use their own spells in the assumed form.//Equipment worn or carried will be dropped if the new form is unable to wear or carry items. If any such item would be constricting or physically harmful to the new form, the transformation slows and alters such that the item is dropped without damage to the items nor harm to the target creature. If the GM decides that any such item cannot be removed in this way, the spell fails.//The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of ability, or may choose to end the spell before that point if they wish.
fm = 4

[ProjectedImage]
mu = 6
il = 5
range = 240
duration = 6t
desc = This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. This illusion looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions (including speech, which is projected from the caster to the illusory image as if by a form of ventriloquism). Any further spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster.//A line of sight between the caster and their illusory self must be maintained or the spell ends. Any effect or action that breaks the line of sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can't directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster's actual position, not the illusory self's position.
fm = 6

[ProtectionFromEvil]
cle = 1
mu = 1
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell protects the caster or a creature touched by the caster (the "subject") from evil; specifically, the spell wards against summoned creatures, creatures with significantly evil intentions, and extraplanar creatures of evil nature. A magical barrier with a radius of 1 foot is created around the subject. The barrier moves with the subject, and provides three specific forms of magical protection against attacks or other effects attempted by the affected creatures against the subject.//First the subject receives a bonus of +2 to their Armor Class, and a similar bonus of +2 on all saving throws.//Second the barrier blocks all attempts to charm or otherwise control the subject, or to possess the subject (such as with MagicJar). Such attempts simply fail during the duration of this spell. Note however that a creature who receives this protection after being possessed is not cured of the possession.//Third, any and all summoned creatures and extraplanar creatures of evil nature are unable to physically touch the subject. Attacks by such creatures using their natural weapons simply fail. This effect is canceled if the subject performs any form of physical attack (even with a ranged weapon) on any affected creature, but the other features of the spell continue in force.

[ProtectionFromGood]
cle = 1

fm = 1
nec = 2
sp = 1
pa = 1

[ProtectionEvil10]
cle = 4
mu = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell functions exactly as ProtectionFromEvil, but with a 10' radius rather than a 1' radius. All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.
fm = 3
nec = 4

[ProtectionNormalMissiles]
mu = 3
range = self
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.
fm = 3
sp = 3

[PurifyFoodandWater]
cle = 1
range = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = With this spell the caster makes contaminated food or water pure and safe to eat or drink. Poison is neutralized and spoilage is reversed by this spell. The spell does not project against future decay, however, nor does it affect magic potions (including, unofrunately, Potions of Poison). The spell affects about 2 pounds of food and/or drink per caster level; note that a quart of water or similar drink weighs just over 2 pounds.
pa = 1

[Quest]
cle = 5
rngeperlvl = 5
duration = special
desc = By means of this spell the caster compels a living creature to perform some specific action or services, or alternately to avoid performing some action. The target creature must be able to hear and understand the caster, or it cannot be affected. This spell will automatically fail if used to compel a creature to engage in some obviously self-destructive action.//A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster for some service. Once subjected to this spell the subject must obey the instructions given by the caster indefinitely, though if the quest is to perform some action the spell effectively ends when that action has been completed.//For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the quest (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers 3d6 points of damage. This damage is limited, in that it will not kill the target; if the damage is enough to do so, roll 1d4 for the number of hit points the affected creature retains (similar to Harm).//If the task assigned to the subject of this spell is open-ended or otherwise unable to be completed, the subject is still compelled to try to perform the task, but the will will end in no more than one day per caster level.//Very clever creatures may be able to subvert the instructions given; the GM must decide on the results of any such attempts.//This spell (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a RemoveCurse spell from a caster of a higher level than the caster of the Quest, or by a Wish, or by the reverse of this spell. DispelMagic does not affect a Quest spell.

[RaiseDead]
cle = 5
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell restores life to a deceased humanoid (as defined in CharmPerson). The caster can only raise a being that has not been dead for more days than the caster has levels. The spirit of the target of this spell must be willing to return. If the target's spirit is trapped or contained in any way, the spell will fail. It will also fail if the target died of old age, as the body simply has no life left in it. Similarly, undead creatures are not affected by this spell as they can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense.//The body of the target must be adequately intact to support life, but all wounds no matter how major are healed. Body parts missing when the target is raised are still missing afterward. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone.//Creatures brought back from the dead always suffer some loss or penalty from the ordeal. Characters lose one level of ability permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). First level characters are reduced to Normal Man status; if the character was already a Normal Man they lose a point of Constitution. These losses are permanent, though of course the character may gain levels in the normal fashion. (Characters reduced to Normal Man status must gain 1,000 XP to return to 1st level).//Monstrous humanoids (orcs, goblins, and the like) lose one hit die, or are reduced to 1/2 hit dice if the monster has just one to start with. Such humanoids who already have 1/2 hit dice are reduced to a single hit point. These lossess are generally permanent, though the GM may allow such creatures in service to a player character to recover by gaining 1,000 XP per hit die the creature would be returning to; treat such a creature as being a retainer for this purpose.//Upon being raised, the target has 1 hit point per level or hit die (using its current reduced figure, of course) with a minimum of 1 hit point. A character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.

[ReadLanguages]
mu = 1
il = 2
range = 0
duration = special
desc = This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any written language. It may be cast in one of three modes://In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode lasts for 1 turn (60 rounds) per caster level.//In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.//In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is permanent.//This spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as spell scrolls or spellbooks; see ReadMagic for such cases.//The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn't otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that creature's mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables the spell to function.
fm = 1
mt = 2
nec = 1
sp = 1

[ReadMagic]
mu = 1
range = 0
duration = permanent
desc = When cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read that text. Casting this spell on a cursed text will generally trigger the curse. All Magic-Users begin play knowing this spell, and it can be prepared even if the Magic-User loses access to their spellbook.
fm = 1

[Regenerate]
cle = 6
dru = 7
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = This is the most powerful of healing spells, able to cause lost or destroyed body parts, even internal organs, of a living creature to grow back and heal. Severed body parts can be put back in place and will reattach fully in one round (or one round per body part if multiple parts are to be reattached), but regrowing any number of lost body parts requires a full turn (60 rounds). In addition, the spell heals 3d8 points of damage just as if it were a normal cure wounds spell.

[Reincarnate]
mu = 6
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = By touching the body of a deceased humanoid, the caster brings them back in an entirely new body. The whole body is not needed; in fact, even the smallest fragment of body is sufficient, so long as that fragment was part of the body at the time of the target's death.//The caster can only reincarnate a being that has not been dead for more than a week. The spirit of the target of this spell must be willing to return. If the target's spirit is trapped or contained in any way, the spell will fail.//Roll a d100 to determine the new form of the target creature://01 Bugbear//02-15 Dwarf//16-29 Elf//30 Gnoll//31-39 Gnome//40-46 Goblin//47-60 Halfling//61-88 Human//89-91 Kobold//92-93 Lizard Man//94-98 Orc//99-100 Choice*//If "choice" is rolled for a player character being reincarnated, the player is allowed to choose the new form from among those on the table above. If an NPC is being reincarnated, the GM may choose or roll again.//When the spell is cast, a new body forms in a nearby location selected by the caster. The body forms over a period of 1 hour, first as a misty outline, then becoming more solid moment by moment until it takes its first breath and awakens. The new form is a young adult, regardless of the age the target became deceased.//The target creature's new body has obviously suffered none of the harm that may have befallen the old one, and is completely healthy.//The target remembers their previous life, and retains the same class as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores must be rerolled. The target loses one level (or hit die); this is a real reduction, not a negative level. The target's HP must be rerolled completely.//Undead creatures are not affected by this spell.
dru = 6
fm = 6

[RemoveCurse]
cle = 3
mu = 4
range = 30
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell removes any and all ordinary curses afflicting a creature. It does not generally remove the curse from a magic item such as a sword or a suit of armor, but a character afflicted by a cursed item of this type will be freed of it long enough to discard the item (a turn, at least).//Some special curses are more difficult to remove, and may require a caster of a certain minimum level. A very few curses created by godlike beings cannot be removed by this spell at all.
fm = 4
nec = 4
sp = 4

[BestowCurse]
cle = 3
mu = 4
range = 30
duration = instantaneous
desc = The reverse of RemoveCurse, this spell allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects://-4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).//-4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.//Each round of combat, the target has a 50 percent chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.//The caster may also invent their own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a RemoveCurse spell.
fm = 4
nec = 4

[RemoveFear]
cle = 1
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.
il = 1
mt = 1
nec = 1
pa = 1

[CauseFear]
cle = 1
range = 120
duration = 2t
desc = The reverse of RemoveFear, this spell causes one target creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns (120 rounds). Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this effect.
il = 1
mt = 1
nec = 1
pa = 1

[ResistCold]
cle = 1
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell makes the caster, or any living creature the caster touches, completely immune to normal cold. The spell also gives protection against magical or otherwise superior cold such as the breath of an Ice Dragon or the IceStorm spell. Specifically, the spell gives the protected creature a bonus of +3 on all saving throws against such effects, and reduces any damage suffered by half (so that for example a successful save vs. the Ice Dragon's breath would reduce damage to just one-fourth normal, and even if the saving throw fails the protected creature only takes half damage).
dru = 1
sp = 1
pa = 1

[ResistFire]
cle = 2
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell makes the caster, or any living creature the caster touches, completely immune to normal heat or fire. The spell also gives protection against magical or otherwise superior heat or fire such as the breath of a Dragon or the Fireball spell. Specifically, the spell gives the protected creature a bonus of +3 on all saving throws against such effects, and reduces any damage suffered by half.
dru = 2
sp = 2
pa = 2

[Restoration]
cle = 6
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = Each casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two negative levels may be removed.//Alternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points. If applied to a character who has temporarily lost ability points, it will restore up to 2d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediatley. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.//This spell cannot restore any levels lost permanently, such as those lost due to death as described for the spells RaiseDead and Reincarnate.//Usage: `!cast restoration <target>` for negative level mode, `!cast restoration <target> <stat> [--perm]` for ability mode

[Shield]
mu = 1
range = self
duration = 5rplus1lvl
desc = This spell creates an invisible shield made of magical force which floats in front of the caster, protecting them from various attack. The spell totally blocks MagicMissile attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster's Armor Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from behind the caster, but MagicMissile attacks are warded off from all directions.
fm = 1

[Silence15]
cle = 2
il = 4
range = 360
duration = 2rlvl
desc = This spell creates a spherical area with a 15 foot radius where no sound will pass. No one within the affected area can make nor hear any sound. Neither does sound issue from the affected area; those outside cannot hear those inside. This effect blocks verbal communication, of course, as well as spell casting.//This effect can be cast in a fixed area, upon an item (making it portable), or upon a creature. An unwilling target receives a save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature's possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save vs. Spells to negate.//This spell can be used to protect against any kind of attack or magic where the victims must be able to hear the attacker, for such attacks cannot pass into or out of the affected area.
mt = 4
sp = 2
pa = 2

[Sleep]
mu = 1
range = 90
duration = 5rlvl
desc = This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice, or a single 4 hit die creature, into a magical slumber. Creatures of 5 hit dice or more are not affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range) and those creatures within 30' of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist.//Victims of this spell can always be hit if attacked. Injuring such a creature will cause it to awaken, and it may begin fighting back or defending itself on the very next round. Slapping or shaking such a creature will awaken it in 1d4 rounds, but normal noises will not.//Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.//When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally at the GM's option.
fm = 1

[SpeakwithAnimals]
cle = 2
range = special
duration = 1t4lvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to speak to and understand any single animal (normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster and able to hear them. The caster may change which animal they are speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn't alter the animal's reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should be made to determine this. The GM should ensure that the animal's manner of speaking reflects its intelligence and nature.
dru = 2
pa = 2

[SpeakwithDead]
cle = 3
range = 10
duration = 3rlvl
desc = With this spell the caster causes the corpse of an intelligent creature to become animated and to answer the caster's questions. It does not matter how long the corpse has been dead, but it must be essentially intact with at least a complete mouth in order to answer questions.//The corpse will answer at most one question per two caster levels, but if the duration expires any remaining questions are lost. The corpse only knows what it knew when it was alive; this includes the languages it knew in life. Thus, the caster must share a language with the deceased in order to get any questions answered at all.//The answers given are drawn from knowledge "imprinted" on the corpse during life; the caster does not in any case actually communicate with the spirit of the deceased creature. The corpse cannot retain any information given to it, and does not even remember any previous instances of communication via this spell.//The answers given may not be useful for various reasons. If the corpse knew the caster when it was alive, or if the caster is a member of a group the deceased disliked, it may choose to lie or mislead the caster. If the caster asks the corpse questions of a personal nature, or questions that indicate the caster may be working against whatever interests the corpse had in life, it will almost certainly seek to mislead the caster.//If the corpse has been roused by this spell within the last seven days, the spell will fail. Undead creatures (including the remains of defeated undead creatures) cannot be affected by this spell.
nec = 3

[SpeakwithMonsters]
cle = 6
range = special
duration = 1t5lvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to speak to and understand any single living monster that is in sight of the caster and able to hear them. The caster may change which monster they are speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to understand the caster. The spell doesn't alter the monster's reaction or attitude towards the caster. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and undead are unaffected by this spell.

[SpeakwithPlants]
cle = 4
range = 20
duration = 1t
desc = This spell allows the caster to speak to and understand any single plant (either normal plant or animate plant creature). The GM should remember that normal plants have a limited sense of their surroundings, and most never move from the place where they sprouted. The spell doesn't alter the plant's reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Plant creatures will tend to be slightly more intelligent, and a reaction roll should be used to determine how such creatures respond to the caster's words.
dru = 4

[SpiritualHammer]
cle = 2
range = 30
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell causes a warhammer made of magical force to appear, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric with range once per round. The weapon moves about as if wielded by a person of about the caster's stature, but no such person is present. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the caster's normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the Cleric loses sight of the weapon, causes it to move out of the spell range, or ceases to direct it, the hammer disappears. The weapon is immune to any normal attack, but can be destroyed by Disintegrate, DispelMagic, or a Rod of Cancellation.
pa = 2

[StickstoSnakes]
cle = 4
range = 120
duration = 6t
desc = This spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster levels. The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to their original stick form. Magical "sticks" such as enchanted staves cannot be affected.//Usage: `!cast stickstosnakes py1 sc2 ss1 pv1` would summon 1 python, 2 spitting cobras, 1 sea snake and 1 pit viper. Any leftover HD after requests are filled will be spent on the fallback pit vipers as they are 1 HD. Casting without addons summons randomly.

[Striking]
cle = 3
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6 points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such a monster, however.
sp = 3

[Telekinesis]
mu = 5
range = self
duration = 3t
desc = This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by concentration alone; the caster can move such things weighing up to 50 pounds per caster level at a rate of up to 20 feet per round. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to resist, whether it is the creature itself being affected or an object in its possession.//In order to use this power the caster must maintain concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no attacks and casting no further spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentionally or not), the power may be used again on the next round but the target of the effect is allowed a new saving throw.
fm = 5
sp = 5

[Teleport]
mu = 5
range = self
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster of this spell is instantly transported to another location up to 100 miles away per level of ability. The spell transported the caster only within their current plane of existence. Other creatures (passengers) and inanimate objects (cargo) may be transported along with the caster, up to a maximum of 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature's possession from being teleported.//The spell is directed by the mind of the caster, who must visualize the destination area; failure to visualize it properly can cause the spell to fail in a variety of ways, and destinations heavily saturated with magical energy (as defined by the GM) will cause the spell to fail automatically.//To determine the results of this spell, choose the appropriate column on the table below, then roll d100://Knows Well - Knows Somewhat - Saw Once - Spell Result//01 - 01-02 - 01-03 - Disaster//02 - 03-07 - 04-13 - Wrong Place//03 - 08-13 - 14-25 - Fell Short // 04-00 - 14-00 - 26-00 - Success!//Knows Well applies when the caster has visited the destination frequenly and/or spent a substantial amount of time there; generally, the caster should have spent at least 7 days at the destination within the last year to qualify for this category. Any place where the caster lived for more than a month in the last ten years, or more than a year in their life, also qualifies.//Knows Somewhat applies when the caster has spent some time in the destination area. Alternately, the caster may have made an in-depth study of the area.//Saw Once applies when the caster has visited the place for as much as a day, but no more, or when the caster has attempted some study.//Success means exactly what it says.//Fell Short indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely 1d8x10 percent of the way to the intended destination. Note that arriving "safely" does not mean that the destination is safe, but only the trip.//Wrong Place means that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive at some place that resembles the intended destination. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range, as decided by the GM. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.//Disaster indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo have encountered dimensional turbulence and have crashed, becoming separated and injured in the process. Each creature including the caster suffers 1d12 points of damage, and then roll again on the same column table using 2d20 instead of d100. If another Disaster is rolled, apply another 1d12 damage, and the cargo disappears forever.
fm = 5

[TrueSeeing]
cle = 5
il = 6
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of transformed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.//True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use TrueSeeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with Clairvoyance.
mt = 6
sp = 6

[Ventriloquism]
mu = 1
il = 1
range = 60
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell causes the caster's voice to appear from some other location within range, for example, from a dark alcove or statue. The caster may choose a new location each round if desired, and can cause the spell to temporarily abate without ending it and then resume it again at any time within the given duration.
fm = 1
mt = 1
nec = 1

[WallofFire]
cle = 5
mu = 4
range = 180
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell creates a vertical sheet of flames in an area indicated by the caster, which is either a wall of flame up to 20' in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5' per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20' tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling). The entire wall must lie within the range given above. One or both sides of the wall may be hot, as determined by the caster at the time of casting. Once created, the wall cannot be moved or changed.//Any creature within 20 feet of a hot side of the wall will suffer 1d4 points of damage each round, or 2d4 points if within 10 feet. Damage is applied on the round the spell is cast and each round thereafter. Actually passing through the wall causes 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 per caster level, even if the side the character or creature entered from was not a hot side.//Undead creatures are particularly susceptible to this spell, and suffer twice the damage described above.//If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10' of the wall.//The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at their option.
dru = 5
fm = 4
sp = 4

[WallofIron]
mu = 6
range = 90
duration = permanent
desc = Using this spell the caster creates an iron wall. The wall stands upright, and consists of up to one 10'x10' square section, one inch thick, per caster level. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in area: for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller than the maximum size if desired. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick, and must always be created in contact with the ground or floor beneath it. It is always a flat plate with no bends, but the edges do not have to be straight; indeed, the caster can cause the wall edge to mold itself around any obstructing object very closely. The wall cannot otherwise be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature.//If the caster wishes, the wall edges will bond to any inanimate materials they touch (stone walls, soil, furnishings, and so on). If this is not done, the wall may be unsupported (as determined by the GM based on the situation) and will thus likely fall. If left unattended, there is an equal chance it will fall in either direction in 1d6 rounds, but it can be pushed in a specific direction by any character having a minimum Strength score of 13, or any monster with 4 or more hit dice. Several creatures an work together to do so if desired. A DC 18 Strength check may be attempted if you do not have the requisite 13 Strength.//When the wall falls, any creatures it falls upon are likely to be injured or killed. If it is possible for a character or creature to escape the area (i.e. it has sufficient movement rate and is not otherwise prevented from doing so), it is allowed to roll a save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). If this save is successful, the creature or character moves by the most direct route to the nearest safe space, if the save fails or it is for some reason impossible to flee, 10d6 points of damage are inflicted on that victim. Creatures larger than ogre-sized are immune to being crushed and will simply be knocked down if the save fails.//The wall is permanent, as indicated, but being made of iron is susceptible to rust and corrosion.
fm = 6
nec = 6
sp = 6

[WallofStone]
mu = 5
rngeperlvl = 15
duration = permanent
desc = Using this spell the caster creates a stone wall. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, one foot thick, per caster level. The caster can form this wall into almost any shape, with some restrictions. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall cannot be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature. It must be adequately supported by existing stone, which it will bond with automatically, but need not be supported over its entire area. For example, a wall of stone may be formed into a bridge over a stream or chasm, so long as both ends of the bridge rest solidly upon (and bond with) existing stone.//Bridges longer than 20 feet must be arched, buttressed, or both in order to stand; this extra construction reduces the wall's usable volume by half, as does creating a wall with battlements, crenelations, and similar basic structural elements. No complex structural elements may be created with this spell.//Though made by magic, the wall is made of stone and can be broken or damaged just as if it were ordinary stone.//The wall can be formed into a container to trap creatures, and if this is attempted the targets of the spell are allowed to save vs. Death Ray to avoid being trapped. If the save is successful the targets are able to make up to one full move to a space outside the container.
cle = 5
fm = 5
nec = 5
sp = 5

[WaterBreathing]
mu = 3
range = touch
duration = 2hlvl
desc = This spell grants living creatures touched by the caster (including the caster, if desired) the ability to breath in water as a fish does. The duration may be divided evenly if the caster touches multiple targets one after another. Affected targets do not lose the ability to breathe air.
cle = 3
dru = 3
fm = 3
sp = 4

[Web]
mu = 2
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 2tlvl
desc = This spell creates a volume of sticky strands resembling a spider's web but much larger and thicker. The spell fills a volume of up to 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight 10'x10'x10' cubes). The webs must be attached to adjacent solid objects such as walls, pillars, and the like; any unsupported section of webbing collapses to the ground and disappears. Within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs they wish, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic feet of volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if they wish.//Creatures within the web at the time the spell is cast, as well as anyone entering the area afterward, wll become entangled. Each should roll a save vs. Death Ray, and any creatures who succeed at this save may move through the webbing but are reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, they are able to act normally again.//Those who fail the save are fully entangled and trapped. They cannot move, cast spells, or perform normal attacks or any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however, each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.//Attacks against an entangled creature by one outside the webbing will not normally entrap the attacker, so long as they do not need to venture into the web to reach the entangled target.//The web can be ignited; any application of fire to the webbing will cause a 10 foot cube to burn away in one round, with all 10 foot cubes ajacent to the destroyed one burning in the next round, and so on. If any part of the web becomes unsupported it will collapse and disappear as noted above.//Creatures trapped within the burning web suffer 2d4 points of damage when the cube they are trapped in burns, but they are thereafter completely free of the web.
fm = 2

[WizardEye]
mu = 4
il = 5
range = 240
duration = 6t
desc = With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical "eye" through which they can see. The eye has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240 feet away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40 feet per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240 feet away from the caster under any circumnstances. The eye cannot pass through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human's eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.
fm = 4
mt = 5
nec = 4

[WizardLock]
mu = 2
range = 20
duration = permanent
desc = This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. The effect lasts indefinitely. Knock can be used to open the doorway without ending the spell, and DispelMagic can be used to end it permanently. The caster of this spell can easily open the door or other portal without ending the spell, as can a magical spellcaster three or more levels higher than the caster.
fm = 2
nec = 2
sp = 2

[WordofRecall]
cle = 6
range = self
duration = instantaneous
desc = With the utterance of a single word this spell transports the caster to a place of refuge which they designate when preparing the spell. The place must be Known Well (as explained in Teleport) to the caster to be so designated. This spell cannot transport the caster beyond their current plane of existence.//The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster.)//Unwilling creatures cannot be transported by this spell, nor can items in their possession. If the caster or one of their passengers is holding an object that is also being held by an unwilling creature, the latter can retain possession of the object with a successful save vs. Spells.
dru = 6
nec = 5
sp = 7

[AdvancedIllusion]
il = 4
range = 180
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This spell functions like the spell SpectralForce except that the illusion follows a script determined by the caster. The illusion follows the script without requiring the caster to concentrate on it. If the illusion includes intelligible speech, however, such speech is likewise scripted, so the illusion will not respond if spoken to.
mt = 4

[AlterSelf]
il = 2
range = self
duration = 10mlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to assume the form of a creature of the same body type (i.e. humanoid). The new form must be within 50 percent of their normal size. The assumed form can't have more hit dice than the caster's level, nor more than 5 HD at most. The caster can change into a member of their own kind or even into themself.//The caster retains their own ability scores, class, level, hit points, attack bonus, and saving throws. If the new form is capable of speech, they can communicate normally and cast spells. The caster acquires the physical qualities of the new form, including armor class, movement capabilities (such as climbing, swimming and flight, but not including magical movement abilities such as levitation), natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial abilities, and any gross physical qualities (wings, additional extremities, etc).//Using AlterSelf does not permit additional attacks, and the caster does not gain any special, supernatural, or spell-like abilities of the new form.
mt = 2

[AudibleGlamer]
il = 1
range = 60
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 2rlvl
desc = AudibleGlamer allows the caster to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed location. The caster chooses what type of sound they create when casting the spell, and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character.//The volume of sound created is equivalent to the noise of two normal humans per caster level. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise an AudibleGlamer produces can be virtually any sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as six humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from twelve humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from twenty humans.//Note that this spell is particularly effective when cast in conjunction with PhantasmalForce.//If a character states that they don't believe the sound, a save vs. Spells is made; if the save succeeds, the character hears the sound as distant and obviously fake.
mt = 1

[Blur]
il = 2
range = touch
duration = 1mlvl
desc = When a Blur spell is cast, the caster causes the outline of the creature touched to appear blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee combat attacks to be made at -4 on the first attempt and -2 on all successive attacks, if the creature is capable of making successive attacks that round. It also grants a +1 on the saving throw die roll against any direct magical attack.//A DetectInvisible spell does not counteract the Blur effect, but a TrueSeeing spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
mt = 2

[ChangeSelf]
il = 1
range = self
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to alter their appearance. This includes not only body shape and facial features, but also clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. The caster can seem up to one foot shorter or taller, and may appear thin, fat, or any size in between. This spell cannot change the overall body shape of the caster (to look like a dog, for example). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to the caster.//The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the caster or his equipment.//A creature that interacts with the caster may, at the discretion of the GM, be allowed a save vs. Spells to recognize the illusion.
mt = 1

[ColorCloud]
il = 3
range = 40
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell is similar to ColorSpray. It causes a vivid cloud of clashing colors, which cause living creatures in the area of effect (or who enter the area of effect) to become blinded or possibly even unconscious. The cloud covers any area up to 20 feet square or 20 feet in diameter, as chosen by the caster. Each creature within the cloud is affected according to hit dice://- 4 HD or less: The creature becomes unconscious for 2d4 rounds, then is blinded for 1d4 rounds.//- 5 to 8 HD: The creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds.//- 9 or more HD: The creature is blinded for 1 round.//All creatures having more levels or hit dice than the spell caster, or having 10 or more levels or hit dice in any case, are entitled to a save vs. Spells to negate the effect. Sightless creatures are not affected by this spell.
mt = 3

[ColorSpray]
il = 1
range = 20
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell causes a vivid cone of clashing colors to be projected from the caster's hands, causing living creatures in the area of effect to become blinded or possibly unconscious. The cone has a 5-foot diameter at the base, 20 foot diameter at the end, and is 20 feet long. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its hit dice://- 2 HD or less: The creature is unconscious for 2d4 rounds, then blinded for 1d4 rounds.//- 3 or 4 HD: The creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds.//- 5 or more HD: The creature is blinded for 1 round.//All creatures having more levels or hit dice than the spell caster, or having 6 or more levels or hit dice in any case, are entitled to a save vs. Spells to negate the effect. Sightless creatures are not affected by ColorSpray.
mt = 1

[DancingLights]
il = 1
range = 40
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 2rlvl
desc = Depending on the version of the spell selected, the caster creates up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape.//The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as the caster desires, up to 100 feet per round. Note that concentration is not required; if ignored, the lights continue to move as they were moving when the caster last directed them. If the lights pass beyond the maximum range, the spell ends immediately.
mt = 1

[DetectIllusion]
il = 1
range = 60
duration = 2t
desc = This spell allows the caster to recognize illusions by sight. To the caster, all illusions within the given range appear slightly translucent and obviously fake. DetectIllusion allows detection of visual illusions only, it does not detect auditory illusions such as AudibleGlamer.
mt = 1

[DispelIllusion]
il = 2
range = 120
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster can use this spell to end all ongoing "illusion spells" within a 20-foot cubic area. DispelIllusion affects spells such as AudibleGlamer, PhantasmalImage, PhantasmalForce, SpectralForce, AdvancedIllusion, and so on. If there is any question as to whether or not a spell is an illusion, the GM's discretion will apply.//Any illusion spell cast by a character of a level equal to or less than the DispelIllusion caster level's is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5 percent change of failure for each level the illusion's caster exceeds the DispelIllusion caster level. For example, a 10th-level caster dispelling an illusion created by a 14th level caster has a 20 percent chance of failure.//When an Illusionist attempts to dispel an illusion cast by a non-Illusionist, the Illusionist is treated as if he or she were two levels higher; if it is not obvious whether the illusion was created by an Illusionist or not, the GM should assume it was./Non-illusion spells cannot be ended by this spell.
mt = 2

[Displacement]
il = 3
range = touch
duration = 2rlvl
desc = When a Displacement spell has been cast, the caster causes the creature touched to appear 2 feet away from its actual position. This distortion causes all missile and melee attacks to be made at -4. It also grants a +2 on the saving throw die roll against any direct magical attack.//A DetectInvisible spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a TrueSeeing spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
mt = 3

[Dream]
il = 5
range = special
duration = special
desc = This spell allows the caster, or a messenger touched by the caster, to send a recipient a message through the recipient's dreams. When the spell is cast, the caster must identify the recipient in an unambiguous way. The messenger (whether the caster or someone else) then appears in the recipient's dream and then delivers the message. The message is purely one-way, and there is no opportunity for questions or interaction. When the recipient wakes up, they will remember the message perfectly.//After casting the spell, the messenger is helpless and completely unaware of their surroundings until the spell ends. If the recipient is awake when the spell is cast, the messenger can either end the spell immediately or wait until the recipient goes to sleep. Once the recipient goes to sleep, the message can be delivered. Whether the messenger has to wait or not, the messenger immediately becomes fully aware again once the message is delivered. Creatures who do not sleep cannot be a recipient of this spell.
mt = 5
sp = 5

[FalseVision]
il = 6
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = Any attempt to observe anything within the area of this spell from most kinds of scrutiny will fail. Those looking into the area see a false image (as the spell advanced illusion), as defined by the caster at the time of the casting. As long as the duration lasts, the caster can concentrate to change the image as desired. While not concentrating, the image remains static. Those inside the affected area can see and hear the outside affected area normally. Anyone inside the affected area are immune to ESP spells.//Divination spells like MagicMirror, Clairvoyance, and Clairaudience cannot perceive anything within the area. FalseVision does not stop creatures or obejcts from moving into and out of the area, but they will likely need to disbelieve the illusion before they try.
mt = 6

[GazeReflection]
il = 1
range = 0
duration = 1rlvl
desc = The spell creates a mirror like image in the air in front of the caster's face. Any gaze attack, such as that from a basilisk or a medusa, will be reflected back upon the attacker when it looks at the caster.
mt = 1

[HypnoticPattern]
il = 2
range = 120
duration = concentration
desc = A shifting pattern of light moves through the air, mesmerizing those who look at it. Roll 2d6 plus the caster level to determine how many HD are affected by the spell. Creatures with the smallest hit dice are affected first, and among those with the same HD, those closest to the effect are affected first. HD of effect that are not sufficient to affect the next creature are wasted. Affected creatures will stop and watch the effect until the duration expires or they are threatened. Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this spell.//The effect continues for 2 rounds after the caster stops concentrating on the spell.
mt = 2

[IllusoryScript]
il = 3
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = This spell allows the caster to write whatever they want on whatever they want. The caster specifies who they want to read it. (This can be an individual, class of individuals, a group, etc.) For anyone else this appears to be an unintelligible magical writing of some kind, though an Illusionist will recognize it as an IllusoryScript.//Any unathorized creature attempting to read the script must save vs. Spells or fall under the effects of a Suggestion. The Suggestion only applies for 30 minutes and must be very short and simple (for example, "Put this down and leave").
mt = 3

[IllusoryWall]
il = 3
range = 60
duration = permanent
desc = This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface, covering up to a 10-foot square area, up to 1 foot thick. The section of wall created appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search may reveal the true nature of the surface; the GM may either allow a save vs. Spells to detect the illusion, or if the probing attempt is well devised the GM may allow it to automatically succeed. In either case, such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.
mt = 3

[ImprovedInvisibility]
mu = 4
fm = 4
il = 4
mt = 4
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell works exactly like Invisibility, except that it does not end if the subject attacks or casts a spell.

[MassInvisibility]
il = 6
mu = 7
fm = 7
nec = 7
range = 240
duration = special
desc = This spell bestows an Invisibility spell on all creatures within a 30-foot by 30-foot area. Each subject will remain invisible until they attack or cast a spell. A subject that leaves the original area of effect remains invisible.
mt = 6

[MassSuggestion]
il = 6
range = 30
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell bestows the effect of a Suggestion spell on all creatures within a 30-foot by 30-foot area. The single suggestion applies to all of the targets. Each target gets its own saving throw.
mt = 6

[Maze]
il = 6
range = 60
duration = 1t
desc = By means of this spell, the caster banishes the target creature into an extra-dimensional labyrinth. Once per round, the victim of this spell may attempt a save vs. Spells to escape the labyrinth. If the victim does not escape, the Maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the victim at that time.//On escaping or leaving the Maze, the target creature reappears where it had been when the Maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as Teleport or DimensionDoor, do not help a creature escape a Maze spell.//Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.
mt = 6

[MirageArcana]
il = 5
range = 120
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell works as HallucinatoryTerrain, except that any kind of terrain may be re-imaged, including terrain, structures, and equipment. This allows buildings to be hidden or added, and other equipment to be hidden or shown. Creatures, however, cannot be disguised or concealed, though they may always hide themselves within the illusion just as they could hide were the illusory terrain real. This spell requires a full turn (60 rounds) to cast.
mt = 5

[Mislead]
il = 5
range = 100
duration = special
desc = The caster becomes invisible (as if by means of ImprovedInvisibility) and at the same time an illusory double of them appears (as if by means of SpectralForce). The caster is then free to go elsewhere while their double moves away. The double appears within the given range, but thereafter moves as the caster directs it (which requires concentration). The double may be controlled at any distance from the caster, so long as the caster remains able to see it.//The caster can make the double appear superimposed perfectly over their body so that observers don't notice an image appearing when the caster turns invisible. The caster and the double can then move in different directions. The double moves at the caster's speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.//The illusory double lasts as long as the caster concentrates upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After the caster ceases concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The ImprovedInvisibility lasts 1 round per caster level, regardless of concentration.
mt = 5

[Nightmare]
il = 5
range = special
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster to send a horrific phantasmal vision through the recipient's dreams. When the spell is cast, the caster must identify the recipient in an unambiguous way. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage to the recipient. They are then unable to regain spells for 24 hours. The recipient is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells, which can be modified by how well the caster knows the recipient and if the caster has some token connected to the recipient.//If DispelEvil is cast on the recipient while this spell is being cast, the Nightmare is dismissed with no effect and the caster is paralyzed for 1 turn per level of the caster performing the DispelEvil.//If the recipient is awake when the spell is cast, the caster can either end the spell immediately or wait in a trance until the recipient goes to sleep. Once the recipient goes to sleep, the message can be delivered. Whether the caster has to wait or not, the caster immediately becomes fully aware again once the message is delivered. The caster is completely helpless physically and mentally while in the trance. Creatures who do not sleep cannot be a recipient of this spell.
mt = 5

[Obscurement]
il = 2
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1tlvl
desc = A bank of fog up to a 20-foot cube in volume billows out from the point the caster designates. The cloud moves at a range of 10 feet per round under the control of the caster (so long as they concentrate on it). The fog obscures all sight, even Darkvision, beyond 5 feet; beyond that all creatures will be effectively blind.//The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it, but a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds and a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round. This spell does not function underwater.
mt = 2

[PermanentIllusion]
il = 6
range = 180
duration = permanent
desc = This spell functions much like AdvancedIllusion except that the spell is permanent. The "script" for this spell simply repeats endlessly.
mt = 6

[PhantasmalImage]
il = 1
range = 180
duration = concentration
desc = This spell is often the first spell an Illusionist will learn. The spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a maximum size of a 20-foot cube. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, temperature, or movement. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.//A save vs. Spells may be granted by the GM any time they feel the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.
mt = 1

[PhantasmalKiller]
il = 4
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = When this spell is cast, it creates a quasi-real creature that is the target's worst possible fear. It is literally the worst possible creature to fight that the target can imagine. Only the target can see the phantasmal killer; the caster sees a rough shape.//The target must make a save vs. Spells to disbelieve the phantasmal killer. If the saving throw is failed, the killer then touches the target, who must then save vs. Petrify or die from fear. Even if the target makes the second saving throw, they still take 3d6 points of damage.
mt = 4

[PhantomMessenger]
il = 3
range = special
duration = special
desc = When this spell is cast, it creates a quasi-real, birdlike creature. It may appear as a small hawk/falcon or as a large dove, and may be any shade of gray from nearly white to nearly black. It does not fight, but all normal animals shun it and only monstrous ones will attack. The messenger has an Armor Class of 18 and 2 hit points, plus 1 per level of the caster. If it loses all of its hit points, the messenger disappears.//The messenger flies at a movement rate of 120 feet per round. It can bear up to one ounce per five full levels of the caster (one ounce up to level 9, two ounces up to level 14, three ounces up to level 19, and four ounces at 20).//When created, the messenger must be given a specific destination, which can be any location on the same plane of existence to which the caster has been at least once (even if they were lost at the time). After the caster attaches any message or small item(s) to the legs of the bird, they release it and it flies without error to the specified location.//The caster may additionally visualize a specific person whom the messenger will seek out near the target location. Note that this does not allow location of a person; the messenger will fly around the target area looking for the designated creature.//The messenger will travel at its maximum movement from the caster to the target location. Distance is no object; the messenger will continue indefinitely until the target area is reached. If a target creature was specified, the messenger will then fly around up to one day per level of the caster looking, until the target creature is found; otherwise the messenger will immediately land in the target area. After it lands the messenger will wait patiently for the message or item(s) to be removed, and then will disappear in a faint puff of smoke or mist. If the item(s) or message are not removed immediately the messenger will disappear anyway after waiting one round per level of the caster, dropping the items on the spot; this will also happen if a target creature is specified and cannot be found (the messenger will land first before this happens so as not to drop any carried objects a great distance).
mt = 3

[PhantomSteed]
il = 3
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = The caster conjures a quasi-real horse-like creature. The steed can be ridden only by the caster or by the one person for whom he or she specifically created the mount. A PhantomSteed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.//The mount has an AC of 18 and 12 hit points. If it loses all its hit points, the PhantomSteed disappears. The steed has a speed of 40 feet per caster level. It can bear its rider's weight and what they carry (the steed cannot carry saddlebags or the like).//These mounts gain additional powers according to the caster level://8th level: Ability to ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.//10th level: Ability to pass over water as if it were firm, dry ground.//12th level: Ability to travel in the air as if it were firm land instead, so chasms and the like can be crossed without the benefit of a bridge. Note, however, that the mount cannot casually take off and fly.//14th level: Ability to fly as if it were a pegasus.//A phantom steed's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.
mt = 3

[PhantomTrap]
il = 2
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = The spell makes a lock or other small mechanism appear to be trapped. Anyone that can Detect Traps, or any spell that can detect traps, will show the item to be trapped, and the person checking will be convinced that the trap is present. Nothing happens if the trap is sprung, as there is no trap. The purpose is to dissuade thieves or make the thieves waste time.
mt = 2

[PhaseDoor]
il = 6
mt = 6
mu = 7
fm = 7
nec = 7
sp = 7
range = touch
duration = 1u2lvl
desc = This spell creates a magical passage through a wall, the floor, the ceiling, or even through a section of ground. The PhaseDoor is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except the caster, who is the only one that can use the passage. The passage is 10 feet deep plus another 5 feet for every three caster levels. The caster disappears when entering the phase door and appears when they exit. If desired, the caster can take one other creature through the door. This counts as two uses of the door.//The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor is it possible to see through it without using it.//A PhaseDoor is subject to DispelMagic, but only from someone who is of higher level than the caster. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, they are harmlessly ejected (determine randomly in which direction).//It is possible to allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting a triggering condition for the door. This condition can be as simple or elaborate as desired. It can be based on a creature's name or identity, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.

[ProgrammedIllusion]
il = 5
range = 180
duration = special
desc = This spell functions like AdvancedIllusion, except that this spell activates when a specific condition occurs. The caster sets the triggering conditon when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as religious belief or magical ability. For example, the spell could be set to trigger when a character wearing robes and a pointed hat enters an area, but not when a Magic-User enters the area.//The spell remains ready indefinitely. When triggered, the spell will last at most 1 round per caster level.
mt = 5

[RainbowPattern]
il = 4
range = 180
duration = concentration
desc = This spell functions as HypnoticPattern, except that is affects up to 24 HD of creatures and the caster may move the pattern by up to 30 feet per round. If moved, all creatures under its effects will follow the flowing lights, trying to keep as close to it as possible. If any affected creatures move into a dangerous area, they get a new saving throw. If the view is moved out of sight by an affected creature, they are no longer affected.//This spell will continue for 2 rounds after the caster stops concentrating on it.
mt = 4

[RopeTrick]
il = 2
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = When this spell is cast upon a piece of normal, non-magical rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extra-dimensional space, similar to a Bag of Holding. Creatures in the space are hidden, beyond the reach of divination spells, unless those spells work across planes.//The space holds as many as eight creatures of man-size or smaller (larger creatures cannot fit through the invisible opening at the top of the rope). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope "disappear." Otherwise, the rope simply hangs in the air.//Spells cannot be cast through the extra-dimensional opening, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extra-dimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot square window were centered on the rope. The window is peresent, but is invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it.//The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extra-dimensional space.//When the spell ends, creatures or objects within the extra-dimensional space are ejected through the window. The rope, if still attached, drops free at the same moment.
mt = 2

[Seeming]
il = 5
range = 30
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell works as ChangeSelf, but instead can affect up to one person per two levels of the caster. All creatures to be affected must be willing and within the given range. The caster may choose which creatures are affected and may include themselves.
mt = 5

[ShadowDoor]
il = 3
range = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = The caster creates the illusion of a door, which they will appear to pass through and close. In reality, the caster becomes Invisible (as the spell) when the spell is cast. Any creatures opening the "door" will see an empty 10-foot square room, of similar style to the surrounding area. The caster remains invisible for the duration of the spell, unless as with an Invisibility spell, they attack any creature or cast a spell.
mt = 3

[ShadowWalk]
il = 6
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = ShadowWalk can only be cast in an area of heavy shadows. The caster and up to one willing creature per level are transported to the shadowy edge of reality. In this region of shadow, the caster (and all the creatures that accompany them) move at an effective rate of 50 miles per hour.//Because of the blurring of reality, the caster can't make out details of the terrain or areas they pass over during transit, nor can they predict perfectly where the travel will end. When the spell effect ends, the caster and any creatures accompanying them arrives 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from the desired endpoint. The caster and their companions always arrive at ground, except if the landing area is in a body of water (in which case they arrive at the water level) or underground. If arriving underground, the altitude of arrival should be as close as possible to the same altitude as the intended endpoint location.
mt = 6

[SolidFog]
il = 4
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This spell functions like Obscurement, but in addition it is so thick that any creature trying to move through it is slowed to a speed of 5 feet, irrespective of its normal movement. It also takes a -2 penalty to all attack and damage rolls made in the fog. The solid fog also stops any physical projectiles, making ranged weapon attacks ineffective. The reduction of movement also applies to falling, so any distance that falls through the fog doesn't count toward falling damage.//This fog is more difficult to disperse than Obscurement; it takes a severe wind (31+ mph) to disperse it, doing so in 1 round.
mt = 4

[SpectralForce]
il = 3
range = 180
duration = concentration
desc = This spell functions like PhantasmalForce, except for the following: sound, smell, and thermal effects are included; creatures created do not necessarily disappear when touched, assuming the caster causes the illusion to react appropriately. For instance the caster displays illusory wounds when the image is attacked. The spell will last for 3 rounds after concentration ceases.
mt = 3

[StinkingCloud]
il = 3
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 10rlvl
desc = The spell functions like Obscurement, but any living creature in the cloud becomes nauseated such that they may not attack, concentrate, cast spells, or do anything other than move. A creature remains nauseated as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the cloud. A creature may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect of the cloud, but must save every round they remain in the cloud.
mt = 3

[Suggestion]
il = 4
range = 30
duration = 1hlvl
desc = The caster influences a target creature by suggesting a course of activity limited to a sentence of two. The Suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.//The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes the activity. The caster can specify conditions that will trigger an activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.//If the recipient creature makes its saving throw, the spell has no effect. A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (-1 or -2 is recommended).//The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the suggestion, i.e. it must be spoken in a language which the spell recipient understands. Undead are not subject to Suggestion.
mt = 4

[Veil]
il = 6
range = 400
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell works as ChangeSelf, but instead can affect any number of willing creatures within the given range. The caster may choose which creatures are affected and may include themselves.
mt = 6

[Activate]
sp = 2
range = self
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster to activate a charged magical item in their hands without expending charges or daily uses (use `-i` when activating eg. `!wand fireballs go1 -i`). The caster must know any activation words required to use the item. This spell will not work on potions. Wands, staves, rods, rings, scrolls, and all other items can be activated by this spell.//This spell does not allow the caster to use an item forbidden to their class.//If the power that the caster wants to activate requires 2 charges, it will drain one charge only.

[AnalyzeMagic]
sp = 2
mu = 2
fm = 2
il = 2
nec = 2
range = 5
duration = special
desc = This spell permits the caster to discover information about a magic item or a permanently enchanted area. For each turn spent studying the enchanted item or area, the caster may learn one feature of the enchantment. Features include spell effects, bonuses, and command words or activating conditions. The GM will choose the order in which the features are revealed, but command words or activating conditions should be last. Note: the number of charges remaining for a charged item is not revealed by this spell.//Each turn of study requires the caster to make a 1d20 roll, adding their Intelligence bonus and level. The total result must be 16 or higher to succeed; any failure ends the spell. A natural 1 is always a failure.//The item or area to be studied must be within 5 feet of the caster for the full duration of scrutiny, and they must maintain moderate concentration.//Even with the best rolls, the caster can only learn about one feature per level of ability. The caster does not initially know how many features an item has, but they know when the last feature is discovered (if the caster makes it that far).
mt = 2

[BreakRestrictions]
sp = 1
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell allows the use of a magical item not normally usable by the caster, be it a staff, potion, or scroll. This spell does not allow the caster to break their own class restrictions regarding weapons or armor use, even if they are magical items.

[ChannelBlast]
sp = 3
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster to drain a charged magical item of its energy to cast a bolt of energy. The touched item loses a charge or one daily use of its powers (scrolls and potions are consumed by this spell), allowing the caster to create an energy discharge. The blast is cone shaped, 60 feet long.//The damage inflicted depends on the item drained://Potion: 3d6//Scroll: 1d6 per level of the spell or 3d6 for non-spell scrolls//Wand: 4d6//Staff: 5d6//Rod or ring: 6d6//Any other (misc magic item, weapon, armor): 4d6//Targets may save vs. Spells for half damage.//Usage: `!cast channelblast <N | Nd6 | potion | scroll[<L>] | wand | staff | rod | ring | misc> <targets...>`

[CharmConstructs]
sp = 4
range = 30
duration = special
desc = This spell allows the caster to take control of a construct, such as a golem. Control is not absolute and is limited as for the CharmPerson spell; the construct is granted a saving throw to avoid control. The construct is allowed a new saving throw each day to break free of the caster's control. Once control is lost, an unintelligent construct will return to the programming as best as possible. An intelligent construct will know it has been controlled against its will.

[Drainblade]
sp = 4
mu = 4
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell imbues an edged weapon with the ability to drain blood with each successful strike made against a living creature. When a living creature is hit by a drainbladed weapon the target suffers an additional point of damage. If the wielder of the weapon is injured, this extra point of damage is transferred to them as healing energy. This cannot heal beyond maximum HP.//Against nonliving creatures, such as undead, golems, etc., this spell has no effect.
fm = 4

[EnhanceArmor]
sp = 1
range = touch
duration = 1t
desc = This spell imparts a +1 to AC to the touched armor or shield as long as the spell lasts.

[WeakenArmor]
sp = 1
range = touch
duration = 1t
desc = The Reverse of EnhanceArmor imparts a -1 to AC of the armor touched. It requires a successful attack roll, and then the target may deny its effect with a successful save vs. Spells.

[EnhanceWeapon]
sp = 1
range = touch
duration = 1t
desc = This spell imparts a +1 bonus to hit and damage to the touched weapon as long as the spell lasts.

[WeakenWeapon]
sp = 1
range = touch
duration = 1t
desc = The Reverse of EnhanceWeapon imparts a -1 to hit and damage of a weapon touched. Casting it in combat requires a successful attack roll; the target may deny its effect with a successful save vs. Spells.

[Familiar]
sp = 2
mu = 2
fm = 2
il = 2
mt = 2
range = touch
duration = special
desc = With this spell, the caster binds a single animal into their service as a familiar. The creature must be present, and the caster must touch it to cast the spell. Only normal (non-magical) creatures of 1-1 hit die or lower and having animal intelligence may be made into familiars. Further, each spellcaster may only have one familiar at a time. If a familiar dies, the caster will not be able to successfully cast this spell again for 2d6 months. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist, and if this roll succeeds, the animal chosen is not compatible with the caster and cannot become their familiar.//The familiar will behave as if permanently charmed by its master, and will perform any task assigned to it to the best of its ability. The creature's morale is increased by 2 points (to a maximum of 11), and it receives improved intelligence equal to 3+1d4 points. Familiars normally capable of speech (such as parrots) or sign language (such as monkeys) can even carry on conversations. Familiars also age at half the normal rate for their kind, so a cat familiar (for instance) might easily live forty years.//The familiar and its master are linked telepathically, allowing normal communication in both directions. The caster can see through the eyes of the familiar with moderate concentration. They can also sense the direction and approximate distance to the familiar (in general terms, such as "northeast more than a mile away" or "south more than a hundred miles and underground") by concentrating fully upon it for 1d6 rounds.//The connection between the master and familiar will extend any distance on the same plane, but if they are on different planes, the familiar saves vs. Spells once per week with success meaning it has been freed from the master. The freed familiar loses all benefits gained from this spell and becomes a normal animal. The master is affected as if their familiar has died. If the familiar was well greated by its former master it will be friendly toward them should they meet again, and the master may cast this spell (even if the normal time limit has not expired) to re-bind the animal as their familiar again.

[GreaterWarding]
sp = 4
range = touch
duration = special
desc = This spell functions similar to MinorWarding, inflicting 6d6 points of damage. It can be activated by non-living creatures (e.g. golems and undead) as well as living creatures.

[GuardsandWards]
sp = 6
range = 200
duration = 2hlvl
desc = This spell casts a ward of misdirection and protection on an area of 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as the caster desires. By dividing the area affected, it is possible for this spell to ward several stories of a stronghold.//The caster must be inside the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area://Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet is concealed (missile attacks have a -1 to hit). Creatures further away are totally concealed (missile attacks have a -4 to hit).//Wizard Locks: All doors in the warded area are WizardLocked.//Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the Web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the GuardsandWards spell lasts.//Confusion: Where there are choices in direction, such as a corridor intersection or side passage, a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50 percent probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect.//Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by an image to appear as if it were a plain wall. This is saved against as if it was a PhantasmalForce spell.//In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects://1) DancingLights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the GuardsandWards spell lasts.//2) A MagicMouth in two places.//3) A MinorWarding in two places.//4) A Suggestion in one place. You select an area of up to a 5 ft square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.//5) A Sleep in two places. You select an area of up to a 5 ft square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area triggers the Sleep spell.//The whole warded area radiates strong magic. A DispelMagic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

[Hardness]
sp = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell imbues the touched item or construct with one point of Hardness for every two levels of the caster.//The item may not be larger than 10 cubic feet plus 1 cubic foot per level of the caster.

[WeakenItem]
sp = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The Reverse of Hardness subtracts one point of harness from the item or construct for every two levels of the caster. If the target item is reduced below 0 Hardness, excess negative hardness is inflicted as damage points.

[HeatMetal]
sp = 2
dru = 2
range = 25
duration = 7r
desc = This spell causes a single item made of ferrous (iron-based) metal to become hot for a brief period of time. The affected item is warm to the touch immediately, and then becomes progressively hotter each round as indicated on the table below. The damage roll indicated is applied to any creature holding or wearing the affected item; a brief touch does no damage.//Round - Temperature - Damage//1st - Warm - None//2nd-3rd - Hot - 1d4 points//4th-5th - Searing - 2d4 points//6th - Hot - 1d4 points//7th - Warm - None//Note that this spell can damage items harmed by heat, such as potions for example, and might boil water, wine, or oil stored in vessels within an affected metal item, possibly causing the affected vessel to burst. Generally this will happen on the 4th or 5th round, when the effect is at its most powerful.

[ChillMetal]
sp = 2
dru = 2
range = 25
duration = 7r
desc = The reverse of HeatMetal is ChillMetal. It inflicts damage in the table as outlined in the HeatMetal spell description, but the damage is caused by cold instead of heat. Note that this can freeze water, congeal oil, and so on. Frozen water might burst its vessel.

[HoldConstruct]
sp = 3
range = 180
duration = 2d8t
desc = This spell has the same effects of HoldPerson but only affects constructs such as golems.

[ImmunitytoNormalWeapons]
sp = 3
mu = 3
fm = 3
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = 5rplus1lvl
desc = This spell temporarily makes the target immune to non-magical weapons. Anyone under the protection of this spell is treated as an enchanted creature for the purpose of magic items (for instance, a Sword +1, +2, vs. Enchanted Creatures).

[MagicMirror]
sp = 4
cle = 4
mu = 4
fm = 4
mt = 4
il = 4
dru = 4
range = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell turns a reflective surface within range into a magic mirror through which the caster can view other creatures. The caster must know and name the creature. The caster and any other creatures viewing the mirror will be able to see the images, but only the caster will hear sound from the viewing. Detection and vision spells can be cast into it with a 3 percent chance per caster level of success. If successful, this allows the caster to cast DetectMagic, TrueSeeing, etc through the mirror.
nec = 4

[MajorSpellImmunity]
sp = 6
range = self
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This works like MinorSpellImmunity, except that the caster is immune to 1st and 2nd-level spells, and reduces by half the spell effects of 3rd and 4th-level spells.

[MassArmorEnhancement]
sp = 4
range = special
duration = 1t
desc = The caster can affect with EnhanceArmor up to 3 armor sets within 30 feet with a +1 bonus for every three levels of the caster.

[MassWeaponEnhancement]
sp = 4
range = special
duration = 1t
desc = The caster can affect with EnhanceWeapon up to 3 weapons within 30 feet with a +1 bonus for every three levels of the caster.

[MinorCreation]
sp = 4
range = self
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell creates a non-magical object of non-living matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. The item produced by this spell may not be a special component to be used in spell research like a dragon's liver or troll blood.

[MinorSpellImmunity]
sp = 4
range = self
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell creates a 1-inch thick green translucent shell around the caster that protects them from the effects of low-level spells, whether they are harmful or beneficial in nature. The caster is immune to the effects of all 1st-level spells and reduces by half the effects of 2nd and 3rd-level spells, both clerical and magical. The caster's own spells are unaffected by the shell and they can at will lower the protection of the shell for 1 round at a time to receive spells from others (like magical healing). At the end of the round, the shell automatically springs back up again.

[MinorWarding]
sp = 2
nec = 2
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell cloaks an object of less than 10 cubic feet with an invisible aura of harmful energy. Thereafter, the first living creature touching the object sets off the ward, receiving 3d6 points of damage. No saving throw is allowed to avoid the damage. The object is unaffected by the discharge of the minor ward.//Non-living creatures, such as undead or golems, will not set off a minor ward. The caster is free to handle the object at will. The maximum duration of the spell is 1 hour per level of the caster.

[MoveEarth]
sp = 6
range = 400
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth. However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The spell can move up to one 150 ft square (up to 10 feet deep) per round.//This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacier-like fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.//The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjust terrain contours before a battle.//This spell has no effect on earth creatures.

[NeutralizePotion]
sp = 4
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell will render a potion touched by the caster inert and non-magical. Touching a person under the effects of a potion immediately dispels the potion's effects. An attack roll is required to touch an unwilling target.//In addition this spell can function as NeutralizePoison (but not as PoisonTouch).

[OvertakeItem]
sp = 3
range = 30
duration = instantaneous
desc = With this spell the caster can activate one magical item not in their possession that they are aware of and within range. The item must be in plain sight for the caster to see; if the item is held or owned by someone else the owner is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to avoid the item's activation.

[Permanency]
sp = 6
mu = 6
fm = 6
nec = 6
range = 10
duration = permanent
desc = This spell is used to make another spell of 6th or lower level permanent. Only arcane magic can be affected: Clerical, Druidic, and other spells of divine nature can not be made permanent. No spell with a permanent or instantaneous duration can be made permanent.//A permanency spell lasts until dispelled. When it is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately. Casting a Permanency spell causes the loss of 1 point of Constitution.//No more than two spells can be made permanent on a single person, item, or place. If a third permanency spell is cast it automatically fails.//A permanency spell is not necessary to make any magical item; using Permanency to bind a spell to an object, person, or place is not the same as crafting a magical item.//Spells that are commonly made permanent on a creature: DetectMagic, ProtectionFromEvil, ReadLanguages, ReadMagic, DetectInvisible, and Fly.//Spells commonly made permanent on items or locations include: Alarm, AnimateObjects, Confusion, DancingLights, GuardandWards, Invisibility, PhantasmalForce, PrivateSanctum, MagicMouth, Symbol, WallofFire, and Web.

[PrivateSanctum]
sp = 5
mu = 5
fm = 5
nec = 5
range = 30
duration = 24h
desc = This spell creates a field impenetrable to most kinds of scrutiny. Those looking into the area from outside see only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. Eavesdroppers do not perceive any sound, no matter how loud, emanating from the area. Those inside the affected area can see and hear outside the affected area normally. ANyone inside the affected area are immune to ESP spells.//Divination spells like MagicMirror, Clairvoyance, and Clairaudience cannot perceive anything within the area.//No speech is possible between those inside and those outside the sanctum. The spell does not prevent other means of communication, such as telepathic communication, or such as that between a Magic-User and a familiar.//PrivateSanctum does not stop creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.

[ProtectionFromLightning]
sp = 4
dru = 4
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = If the caster touches themself, this spell grants temporary immunity to lightning or electrical effects (normal and magic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of magical lightning damage, it is discharged. Otherwise the spell lasts for 1 turn (60 rounds) per caster level.//If the spell is cast upon another creature than the caster, ProtectionFromLightning grants temporary immunity against normal lightning or electrical effects. The spell also offers a +4 bonus to saving throws against magical lightning and if the save is successful, the creature suffers no damage (and only 25 percent if the save fails). This version of the spell lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

[Repair]
sp = 1
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = With this spell the caster repairs 1d6+1 points of damage by laying their hand upon the broken item, be it a vehicle, golem, etc.

[RetrieveEnergy]
sp = 2
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster to drain a charged magical item of its energy to cast a spell. The touched item loses a charge or one daily use of its powers (scrolls and potions are consumed by this spell), allowing the caster to retain its energy.//In the following round the caster can cast any spell they have memorized without expending the spell slot. The maximum level that can be cast depends on the item drained://Potion: up to 2nd level//Scroll: up to level of the spell or 3rd level for non-spell scrolls//Wand: up to 3rd level//Staff: up to 4th level//Rod or ring: up to 5th level//Any other (misc magic item, weapon, armor): up to 3rd level//If no spell is cast in the round immediately following the casting of this spell, the retrieved energy is lost.//Usage: after casting, use `!charges set (item) (1 less than before)/(max charges)`, then cast spell next turn with `-i`

[RocktoMud]
sp = 5
dru = 5
range = 150
duration = permanent
desc = This spell turns natural, uncut or un-worked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud; up to two 10-foot cubes per caster level may be so transformed. Magical stone is not affected by this spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5' and causing it to suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and armor class. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet, suffering none of the other penalties given.//If RocktoMud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool to a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed a save vs. Death Ray.//Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since rock to mud cannot affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such a building's foundation. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even toppled by this spell.//The mud remains until a successful DispelMagic spell restores its substance (though not necessarily its form). Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

[MudtoRock]
sp = 5
dru = 5
range = 150
duration = permanent
desc = The reverse of RocktoMud, this spell converts the same volume of mud into relatively soft stone (such as limestone or sandstone) permanently. Any creature in the mud must save vs. Death Ray to escape before the area transforms into rock, assuming they have enough movement to do so.

[SecretChest]
sp = 5
range = special
duration = 60d
desc = This spell hides a chest in an extra-dimensional space for as long as 60 days. Regardless of the chest's actual size (about 3'x2'x2') it can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level. The caster can retrieve the chest at will; the chest will appear beside the caster. If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75 percent chance that the spell simply fails.//After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5 percent per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally.

[SeriousRepair]
sp = 3
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell repairs 2d6+1 points of damage by laying their hand upon the injured item, be it a vehicle, golem, etc.

[StarlightBlade]
sp = 5
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = When cast upon a weapon, starlight blade enhances its abilities against undead creatures of all types. The weapon immediately begins to glow with a silvery radiance and with each stroke leaves a trail of white sparkles, like stars in the night sky. Any undead creature struck suffers an additional 1d6+1 points of damage. In addition, the wielder of the weapon may roll to Turn the creature as if a 5th-level Cleric. Contrary to this spell's name, StarlightBlade works equally well on any type of weapon.

[StoneShape]
sp = 3
cle = 4
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster to shape, bend, and form an existing piece of stone (of up to 10 cubic feet + 1 cubic foot per level) into any shape they wish.//Fine detail is not possible but primitive doors, walls, bridges, or similar items can be created with the spell. Stone shaped in the form of moving or mechanical parts will not work on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6. (`!cast stoneshape -fine`)

[WarpWood]
sp = 2
dru = 2
range = 50
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster causes non-magical wood in a 20-foot radius to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open or becomes stuck; a boat or ship springs a leak; warped weapons (like bows and arrows) are useless. The caster may warp wood object(s) up to 1 foot on all sides per caster level.//Alternatively, the caster can "un-warp" non-magical wood (effectively warping it back to normal), straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. The caster can combine multiple consecutive WarpWood spells to warp (or un-warp) an object that is too large to warp with a single spell.

[AnimalFriendship]
dru = 1
range = 30
duration = permanent
desc = Upon encountering a normal or giant-sized (but not magical) animal, the caster may begin casting this spell, which requires an hour to complete. During this period the animal will remain nearby, and will not attack the caster or his or her allies for the duration of the casting (so long as they do not attack or otherwise disturb it). At the end of the casting, if the animal rolls a successful save vs. Spells, the spell has failed. At this point the animal acts naturally, without bearing the caster any special ill-will.//If the animal fails its save, it becomes an animal friend and joins the caster for the rest of its natural life, assisting in any way it can. Both the caster and any other animal friends are treated as treasured partners. There is no arcane mental connection, nor any particular control, but rather a strong fraternal bond which should go both ways. If the animal is treated poorly, or its love not returned over a period of time, it can attempt another save vs. Spells at the GM's discretion.//A caster may only have, at most, twice his or her level in hit dice of animal friends. If this spell is cast on an animal that would put the total above that number, it has no effect.

[AssumeAnimalForm]
dru = 3
range = self
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to change into the form of any natural animal. The assumed animal form cannot have more hit dice than the caster's level. If slain, the caster reverts back to his or her original form.//The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. The caster may remain transformed up to one hour per level, or end the spell earlier if he or she so desires.

[CallLightning]
dru = 3
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = Immediately upon completion of the spell, and at most once per round thereafter, the caster may call down a 5ft wide, 30ft long vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whichever target point the caster chooses within the spell's range (measured from the caster's position at the time of casting). Any creature in the target area or in the path of the bolt is affected; a successful save vs. Spells reduces damage taken by half.//The caster needs not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first the caster may choose to call a bolt instead of taking some other action. The caster may call a total number of bolts equal to one-third of his or her caster level, rounded down.//If the caster is outdoors and in a stormy area - a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental) - each bolt deals 3d8 points of damage instead of 3d6.//This spell functions only where the open sky is accessible, generally meaning outdoors; bolts may be summoned through windows or skylights at the GM's discretion.

[CallWoodlandBeings]
dru = 4
range = 120
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell summons woodland creatures. They appear where the caster designates and act immediately, on his or her turn (they cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them). They attack the caster's opponents to the best of their ability. If the caster can communicate with the creatures, he or she can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies or to perform other actions.//The caster may conjure one type of creature from this list, at his or her option://- 4 Centaurs,//- 16 Pixies,//- 2 Treants, or//- 4 Unicorns.//This spell only works outdoors in a natural location; it will not function in any artificial structure, nor within the boundaries of any village, town, or city.

[AnimateNaturalObjects]
dru = 6
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell functions identically to the cleric spell AnimateObjects, but it may only be cast on living trees, plants, or fungi, wooden objects, un-worked stone or earth, or naturally-occurring bodies of water or ice. At the GM's option other natural phenomena such as non-magical fires or weather effects might also be subject to this spell.

[CommuneWithNature]
dru = 5
range = special
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster becomes one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. After 10 minutes of concentration, the caster instantly gains knowledge of one fact per caster level among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, presence of settlement or structure, or even the general state of the natural setting.//In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings - caves, caverns and the like - the radius is limited to 100ft per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in homes, castles and towns.

[ControlTemperature10]
dru = 4
range = self
duration = 1hlvl
desc = The caster can change automatically the surrounding temperature (10 ft radius sphere) by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit per caster level. The change can be upward or downward (caster's choice).

[ControlWinds]
range = special
duration = 10mlvl
desc = The caster alters wind force around him or her (40 ft per caster level radius cylinder 40 ft high). The caster can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until the caster chooses to alter it, which requires concentration. The caster may create an "eye" of calm air up to 40 ft radius around him or her and may choose to limit the area of effect to any cylindrical area less than his or her full limit.//The caster may choose wind patterns over the spell's area. He or she can choose a downdraft that blows from the center outward, an updraft that blows from the outer edges in toward the center, a rotation that cuases the winds to circle the center or a blast that simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across an entire area from one side to the other.//For every three caster levels, the caster can increase or decrease wind condition by one level (as described in the Waterborne Travel section of the Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules).
dru = 5

[DetectSnaresandPits]
range = 60
dru = 1
duration = 10t
desc = By means of this spell, the caster can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.//This spell does detect certain natural hazards, for instance quicksand (detected as a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.//The amount of information revealed depends on how long the caster studies a particular area.//- 1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards.//- 2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside the caster's line of sight, then the caster discerns its direction but not its exact location.//- Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by the caster.//Each round, the caster can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

[Entangle]
dru = 1
range = 200
duration = 3rlvl
desc = This spell causes existing grasses, trees, bushes, shrubs, or other plants to entwine around creatures in a 40ftx40ft area. At the GM's discretion a caster underground may use roots of plants or trees if such are present. Most creatures within the area of effect move at one fourth normal speed; very large and/or very strong creatures (at least as big or strong as a giant or dragon) move at one half normal speed. If the creature affected is running at the time the spell is cast, the creature must make a saving throw vs. Spells (with Dexterity bonus applied) or trip and become prone and trapped until the end of the spell. Entangled creatures may not attack nor take most actions other than movement due to the interference of the enchanted plants. This spell is only effect in a setting where plants will grow, including wilderness areas, farmland, and earthen-walled tunnels.

[FaerieFire]
dru = 1
range = 200
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1mlvl
desc = A pale glow surrounds and outlines all objects including individuals within a 20 ft radius from a point chosen by the caster. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, and the spell effectively negates the effects of blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

[FlameStrike]
dru = 5
range = 60
duration = instantaneous
desc = A flame strike produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward (cylinder of 10 ft radius, 30 ft high). The spell deals 6d8 points of damage to any creatures within the area of effect; a save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed.

[HoldAnimal]
dru = 3
range = 180
duration = 2d8t
desc = This spell functions like HoldPerson, except that it affects only animals; specifically, this means non-magical living creatures of animal intelligence, including giant-sized animals. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist this spell.

[ObscuringMists]
dru = 2
range = 20
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell causes a bank of misty vapor to arise around the caster, remaining stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 2d4 feet. A strong wind can disperse the spell in one-quarter the usual duration.

[PartWater]
dru = 6
range = 60
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell, when cast on a body of water, causes it to part. This exposes a path that can be traversed as if it were dry land. Note that this spell does not change the topography of the bottom of the body of water, so the terrain may still be difficult to cross. The caster is able to affect a body of water up to 5ft per caster level. The caster may dismiss this spell at any time.

[PassTree]
dru = 6
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster and up to two others to teleport between any two living trees on the same plane. The caster chooses a general location or a specific tree. The caster must have personal knowledge of the specific tree or general area of the target destination.

[PassWithoutTrace]
dru = 1
range = touch
duration = 1hrlvl
desc = This spell permits up to one creature per caster level to move through any type of terrain, leaving neither footprints nor scent. Tracking the subjects by non-magical means is thus rendered impossible.

[PlantGrowth]
dru = 3
range = special
duration = permanent
desc = This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines) within 400 ft + 40 ft per caster level to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Movement rate is reduced to a maximum of 5 ft./round, or 10 ft for Large creatures. The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect. An area up to 100 ft radius may thus be altered. Also, the caster may specify an area (a path, a clearing, etc.) within the given area of effect which is not so affected.//This spell has no effect on plant creatures, that is, any self-willed and/or aniamted plant.

[ProduceFlameCold]
dru = 2
range = self
duration = 1mlvl
desc = Flames as bright as a torch appear in the caster's open hand. The flames don't harm the caster or his or her equipment. Alternatively, a bluish, cold aura may be produced, which also sheds light as bright as torchlight.//In addition to providing illumination, the flames or cold aura can be hurled or used to touch enemies. The caster can stroke an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire or cold damage respectively equal to 1d6 +1 per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, the caster can hurl the flames or cold aura up to 50 ft as a thrown weapon. When doing so, the caster must make an attack roll (with no range penalty), and on a successful hit deals the same damage as the melee attack. As soon as the caster hurls the flames or cold aura, a new one appears in his or her hand. Each attack made reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends with that attack.//Neither variation of this spell functions underwater.//Usage: `!cast produceflamecold (flame/cold)` - shortening/partial parsing is allowed, therefore ex. `!cast produce cold` works fine

[ProtectionFromFire]
dru = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = If the caster touches himself or herself, this spell grants temporary immunity to fire (normal and magic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of magical fire damage, it is discharged. Otherwise the spell lasts for 1 turn (60 rounds) per caster level.//If the spell is cast upon another creature than the caster, ProtectionFromFire grants temporary immunity against normal fire. The spell also offers a +4 bonus to saving throws against magical fire and if the save is successful, the creature suffers no damage, and only one fourth damage even if he fails the saving throw. This version of the spell lasts for 1 turn (60 rounds) per caster level.

[SlowPoison]
dru = 2
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = The creature touched by the caster becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. SlowPoison does not care any damage that poison may have already done, with exception of the following circumstances://If cast on a character who received lethal damage from poison the previous round, the spell will remove that round's poison damage only, and delay it for the duration of the spell. Prior poison damage will remain unaffected, but, as noted above, no further damage is accrued until the spell lapses, and will never accrue if the poison is neutralized while the spell is in effect. This will give the poisoned victim an opportunity to seek a cure to neutralize the poison before it is fatal.

[SummonAnimals1]
dru = 4
rngeperlvl = 40
duration = 1h
desc = This spell summons 1d8 ordinary animals (including giant ones) of no more than 4 HD each if they are within range. The caster must name the type of animal summoned, and can have up to three choices. If none of the three species are found within range, the spell fails. The animals will be friendly when summoned and aid the caster's current task, including combat, in whatever way they can (to the best of their understanding). The caster may dismiss any animals called by this spell at any time.//Use `!animals` for a list of choices.

[SummonAnimals2]
dru = 5
rngeperlvl = 60
duration = 1d
desc = This spell is a more powerful version of SummonAnimals1. Up to 3d4 animals of 4 HD or less can be summoned, or 1d6 animals of 8 HD or less.

[SummonAnimals3]
dru = 6
rngeperlvl = 80
duration = 1d
desc = This spell is a more powerful version of SummonAnimals2. Up to 4d6 animals of 4 HD or less can be summoned, or 3d4 animals of 8 HD or less, or 1d4 animals of 12 HD or less.

[TreeSanctuary]
dru = 4
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell enables the caster to create an invisible door in the trunk of a tree that is visible only to dryads and Druids. The tree must be at least 10 ft tall and planted in the earth for this spell to work. Once the spell is complete, the caster may enter the tree, effectively disappearing from sight. A caster may only affect one tree with this spell at a time. Furthermore, this spell may only be cast on a tree occupied by a dryad if the dryad allows it.//The caster is completely aware of his surroundings while in the tree, being able to hear normally and see in a 360 degree radius, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the tree. A Druid or Cleric may meditate to prepare spells in the tree. Each turn the caster slepps inside the tree counts as a full hour of sleep. If the tree is an oak, the caster heals 1d4 hit points per turn spent inside the tree.//The caster loses the senses of taste, smell, and touch, and may not speak or cast spells while inside the tree. The caster takes half of any damage the tree suffers, and if the tree is destroyed or cut down, the caster is forcefully expelled into the nearest available space.

[WeatherSummoning]
dru = 6
range = 10 miles
duration = 5tlvl
desc = The caster is able to summon nearby weather conditions. The caster must be aware of the weather condition to summon it. This spell does not grant control of the weather to the caster.

[BlackTentacles]
nec = 4
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = A field of 10-foot-long rubbery tentacles will spring from the ground. The area is up to 30 by 30 feet, and they will appear from whatever surface is present, including water.//The tentacles will attack any creature in the area with the intent to wrestle them (see the wrestling rules in the Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules). They attack with the caster's attack bonus and are considered to have a Strength of 18. There are more than enough tentacles to individually attack as many targets as can be present. If the attack succeeds, the target is held immobile and takes 1d6 points of damage each round it is held.//Any creature that is not held by a tentacle may still only move through the affected area at half speed.

[Blight]
nec = 5
dru = 5
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell withers a single plant of any size. It causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to the touched plant creature. The creature is allowed a save vs. Spells for half damage. If the plant is not a creature, it immediately withers and dies with no saving throw.//Only the touched plant is affected; the spell has no effect on anything else in the area.

[Boneskin]
nec = 2
range = self
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The caster manifests a chitinous bone-like armor, giving the caster a +4 bonus to AC. No actual bulk is added to the caster, so it doesn't affect other spellcasting.

[CallPoltergeist]
nec = 1
rngeperlvl = 5
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell binds a minor spirit to an area. The poltergeist is an invisible, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at the Necromancer's command. A poltergeist can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The poltergeist can only perform one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as the Necromancer remains within range. A poltergeist can only open normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like, having an effect Strength score of 3. The poltergeist can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which may not be enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices.

[Chill]
nec = 1
range = 10
duration = 2r
desc = This spell does 1d4 points of damage to one creature within range. Furthermore, the creature must save vs. Paralysis or suffer -1 to melee hit and damage rolls for 1d6 rounds. A large heat source nearby gives a +2 to the save. The caster may use the Chill attack again in the following round without expending an additional spell slot.

[CommandUndead]
nec = 2
range = 30
duration = special
desc = This spell allows the caster to influence an undead creature. If the undead creature is intelligent, this spell operates as CharmPerson, except that the caster can influence 2 HD per caster level, instead of just a flat 4 HD. It otherwise operates the same, including duration.//If the undead creature is unintelligent, the caster immediately gains completely control, the creature gets no saving throw, and the duration is permanent. Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the total control limit from Reanimation.

[ControlUndead]
nec = 6
cle = 6
range = 60
duration = 6rlvl
desc = This spell allows for complete control of up to 3 HD/caster level of undead for a short period of time. Verbal control is required, but they will understand regardless of the language used. If communication is not possible, they will still not attack. Intelligent undead creatures may save vs. Spells to resist and will remember if they are controlled. Unintelligent undead do not get a saving throw and the control is permanent. Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the total control limit from Reanimation.

[CorpseFeast]
nec = 4
rngeperlvl = 5
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell heals the caster and nearby active undead beings by draining the last energies from any fresh corpses (no more than an hour old) within the spell range. The corpse must have been a living creature and not one of the following times: animal, undead, construct, elemental. Any corpse drained using this spell provides vigor to the caster and their active undead allies within range, healing 1d4 hit points per corpse, up to their maximum. Slain or destroyed undead do not heal or rise anew. Any corpses consumed by this spell cannot be raised or resurrected by any means, even a wish.

[CorpseServant]
nec = 1
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to temporarily animate skeletons or zombies. A number of hit dice up to the caster's level may be animated for up to one hour per caster level. These non-permanent undead do not count towards the Reanimation spell limitations, but they otherwise conform to the permanent undead created by that spell. Only one instance of this spell may be active at a time for any particular caster.//Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life (2). An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be reanimated.//Usage: `!cast corpseservant sk5 zo3` would summon 5 skeletons and 3 zombies, assuming you can afford that many HD (skeletons are 1, zombies are 2).

[DecayFlesh]
nec = 1
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This is a version of the CauseLightWounds spell, dealing 1d6+1 points of damage to the creature affected by it. The caster must make a successful attack to inflict the damage. A missed attack roll does not dispel the effect, as it can be active until used or until a number of rounds equal to the caster's level have passed.//Unlike the Clerical spell mentioned, this spell may not be reversed. However, this spell does work upon undead creatures in the opposite fashion; they are healed 1d6+1 hit points instead.

[Ectoplasm]
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = When cast upon a willing intelligent creature, this spell grants the being the ability to become semi-transparent and immaterial. While in this ectoplasmic state, magical weapons or weapons with certain special properties are necessary to strike the recipient. Any stealth checks such as Move Silently or Hide are made at +20 percent, and the character may move through materials up to 1 inch thick per level of the caster. Some materials may prevent passage such as lead, gold, or other materials with special properties (as determined by the GM). While able to move through materials and effectively weightless, the ectoplasmic being does not gain any other special movement modes like flying or levitation; walking upon materials such as water is possible though.//The character in an ectoplasmic state may not make physical attacks but may cast spells that do not require physical contact. While the spell is active, the individual may choose to revert back and forth between corporeal and incorporeal forms on their turn, remaining in the chosen state until the next turn. The spell cannot be cast upon an unwilling individual and fails completely if attempted. Likewise, unintelligent or animal intelligence creatures do not possess understanding of changing their physical state, so the spell is wasted on them.

[Enervation]
nec = 4
range = 50
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster points a finger at their intended target and rolls a ranged attack roll against the target that ignores armor (but not any Dexterity bonus). If the narrow ray of crackling black energy hits, the target suffers 1d4 negative levels and all of the effects of Energy Drain. There is no saving throw, only the attack roll.//If the target survives, it will lose the negative levels after a number of hours equal to the caster's level.//An undead creature struck by the ray gains 5d4 temporary hit points for one hour.

[Eyebite]
nec = 6
range = 60
duration = 1r3lvl
desc = Each round the caster may target a single living creature for the duration of the spell. The affected creature suffers effects depending on its total hit dice. If the target has 10 HD or more, it is sickened. If the target has 5 HD through 9 HD, it is panicked and sickened. If the target has 4 HD or fewer, it is comatose, panicked, and sickened. The effects are cumulative and concurrent. Targeting each additional creature after the first requires an action, and only one may be targeted in a given round.//The target must save vs. Death Ray to avoid the worst effect of the spell. If the target is affected by more than one effect, the remaining effects are still present.//If a creature is sickened, it suffers a -2 modifier for attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 turn (60 rounds) per caster level.//If a creature if panicked, it will flee for 1d4 rounds. After that, the victim will flee again for 1d4 rounds if it can still see the caster. Even after the fleeing ends, the creature is still affected by the sickening as described above.//If the creature is comatose, it falls into a coma for 1 turn (60 rounds) per caster level. During this time, the victim cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. Even if the coma is dispelled, the creature is still subject to fleeing if the caster is visible, and is still sickened. This is not a sleep effect.

[FireskullFamiliar]
nec = 2
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell animates a single skull that serves the Necromancer. Wrapped in cold magical flames and gifted with a form of levitation-based flight, the flaming skull can fetch small items, convey messages, or other similar tasks for the Necromancer. When not tasked with a specific duty, the familiar generally hovers near its master, providing light equal to torchlight. A Necromancer may only have one instance of this spell active at a time. Subsequent castings have no effect unless the first instance of the spell is dismissed or destroyed.//The fireskull familiar is not designed for combat, having hit points equal to one fourth the Necromancer's total hit points. The skull has an Armor Class of 13 and only a single attack for 1d2 points of damage, attacking with the same basic chance to hit as the Necromancer. The skull can be charged with spells that must be delivered by touch. While a fireskull familiar is within 5 feet, the caster's chance of being surprised is reduced by 1.//Of interesting note, although each skull does not remember any details of its former life, it does retain many personality traits, making each skull distinct from the next. Practicioners of this spell often have favorite skulls that they use regularly, and skulls that they are loathe to animate. Any particular skull that is destroyed through damage may never again be used.

[Fossilize]
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = This spell permanently hardens the bones of one skeletal undead creature, making the bones denser and stronger. The fossilized skeleton permanently gets +2 on damage rolls, +4 on its AC, and its damage resistance is enhanced. A fossilized skeleton takes only 1 damage from any slashing attack, and resists all other weapon attacks - and is immune to normal arrows, bolts, and bullets. Magic arrows still work.//While the spell is permanent, there is a drawback. The newly-fossilized skeleton may not be repaired or otherwise 'healed', as the organic materials that made up the bones has been completely replaced by minerals. Intelligent skeletal undead would not normally want this spell applied to themselves, but the spell would affect them nevertheless.

[GhoulishHands]
nec = 2
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell causes the hands of one living creature to become like the horrible claws of ghouls. The bearer of these ghoulish hands may make two claw attacks that cause 1d4 points of damage each. If the recipient of this spell already had better claw attacks, then they gain a +2 damage bonus to their damage rolls while this spell is in effect. In addition to the damage, those struck by the hands must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns (a turn is 60 rounds). Elves are immune to this effect.//Recipients of this spell must be true living creatures; other creatures such as undead, constructs, elementals, and the like are immune. There is a 1 percent non-cumulative chance that on any particular casting of this spell that the recipient is actually infected with ghoul fever (per the monster description), which if proper curative steps are not taken, may ultimately result in the recipient's death and rising as an actual ghoul.

[GraveSanctuary]
nec = 4
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = Similar to the Druid spell TreeSanctuary, this spell enables the caster to create an invisible entry into a grave, mausoleum, sarcophagus, large tombstone, or similar item associated with the repose of the dead. The entry is visible to undead and other Necromancers, but this does not grant any special access to the doorway. Once the spell is complete, the Necromancer may enter the space, effectively disappearing from sight. Only one grave may be effected by GraveSanctuary at a time.//The Necromancer is completely aware of their surroundings while in the grave, gaining the bonus of 360-degree vision and hearing, as well as being able to detect changes in the immediate temperature surrounding the site. Another benefit of this spell is that each turn the Necromancer rests inside the grave counts as a full hour of sleep, so the Necromancer may meditate to memorize spells while within the magical sanctuary. Also, if the grave site is on unhallowed ground or an area otherwise associated with hauntings and the like, then the Necromancer heals 1d4 HP per turn (60 rounds) spent inside the grave.//While inside the grave, the Necromancer does lose any sense of taste, smell, or touch, and may not speak or otherwise cast spells while inside the grave's protection. If the grave itself is unearthed or broken into in some way, then the Necromancer takes 2d10 points of damage and is cast out into the nearest available space. This kind of undertaking should be roughly equivalent to actually digging a grave up, and not simply an attack against the earth.

[GreaterFear]
nec = 4
il = 5
mt = 5
range = 30
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell sends an invisible wave of fear out forward of the caster to a range of 30 feet. Anyone in the area must save vs. Spells or be panicked. A panicked creature will drop whatever it is holding and flee using any means necessary. If cornered, the creature will cower in fear. The victim will also suffer a -2 to all saving throws. The creature will do this for the duration of the spell. If a save is made, the victim is still shaken and suffers -2 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1 round.

[HaltUndead]
nec = 3
range = 200
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell will render up to three undead creatures immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to HoldPerson, but only affecting undead and potentially affecting more than one target). Intelligent undead get a save vs. Spells to avoid; unintelligent undead get no saving throw.

[LocateCorpse]
nec = 1
range = 360
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of the closest corpse or remains of a type usable for spells such as Reanimation or other similar spells. Throughout the duration, the caster need simply concentrate on the general type of corpse (animal, humanoid, large size, etc) and of applicable state (intact, fresh, skeletal, etc). The nearest remains fitting the criteria is located if more than one is within range. Upon arrival at the location of the nearest corpse, the caster can again concentrate to locate another corpse, as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures, whether living or in states of undeath, cannot be found by this spell.

[MaggotSpray]
nec = 2
range = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = From the caster's mouth sprays a stream of filth containing live flesh-eating maggots, affecting all within a 10-foot section immediately adjacent to and chosen by the caster. Those struck by the spray must save or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (like the Stench spell, causing a penalty of -2 to their attacks). Additionally, the maggots eat into the flesh, causing 1d4 points of damage immediately and on subsequent rounds an additional 1d4 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level. Individuals may stop the damage by using an entire round to brush off the maggots (no movement, attacks, and loss of Dexterity or shield bonuses during this round). Those taking the time to brush off the maggots take normal damage that round. Removing the maggots does not remove the sickening effect of those who failed their save.

[MaskofLife]
nec = 5
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell makes a single undead creature appear to be alive. The caster can decide which race and style of clothes is worn by an undead creature. The spell will also make the target's movements appear life-like. The illusion will create appropriate ambient effects (smells, sounds, clothing, textures, and such) that would be expected for the life-like appearance. If the appearance is that of a living version of the target, anyone interacting with the target takes a -5 penalty to any saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the target attacks or does anything that only the undead creature would do, the penalty is removed.

[Mummify]
nec = 5
cle = 5
range = touch
duration = permanent
desc = After careful ceremonial preparations lasting five days, and the application of many rare and expensive unguents, the caster is able to call back the spirit of the dead to reanimate its corpse as a mummy. Mummies so created are of the standard sort (see its monster entry). Mummies do not count against the normal limits of controllable undead (per Reanimation spell), but the caster can maintain control over as many Hit Dice of mummies as their own level.//Mummies do not travel well, being slow and quickly wear down, taking damage on long journeys. They make better guardians for the animator's lair. A separate casting of the spell is necessary for each mummy created. It might be possible to create a mummy from a large humanoid such as a giant, however the difficulty will be greater (the GM determines how much more difficult). More powerful mummies, such as those with intact class-based powers, are generally created through the use of the Undeath spell.//Mummification is generally in the realm of the Necromancer, but occasionally Clerics of certain cults might have access as well.

[ProtectionFromUndead]
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell works almost identically to the ProtectionFromEvil spell by warding a creature from attacks by undead creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures regardless of any moral or ethical leanings. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects://First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws. Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects caused by undead creatures or beings that the GM decides have a strong connection with death or undead.//Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a MagicJar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the proteted creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the ProtectionFromUndead spell. If the spell effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.//Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are undead or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
nec = 1

[ProtectionFromLiving]
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell functions in all ways as ProtectionFromUndead, save that living creatures are kept away, rather than dead or undead creatures. Necromancers often use both versions of this spell to protect themselves from threats by both the living population as well as powerful undead that may try to command the Necromancer, such as ghosts or vampires.
nec = 1

[ProtectionUndead10]
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This spell functions exactly as ProtectionFromUndead, but with a 10-foot radius rather than 1. All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.

[ProtectionLiving10]
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This spell functions exactly as ProtectionFromLiving, except that it covers a 10-foot radius around the target rather than 1.

[RayofExhaustion]
nec = 3
range = 50
duration = 6rlvl
desc = The caster points a finger at their intended target and rolls a ranged attack roll against the target that ignores armor (but not any Dexterity bonus). If the narrow black ray hits, the target must save vs. Spells or suffer a -6 adjustment to its Strength and Dexterity for the duration of the spell. If the save is made, the reduction is only -2.

[Reanimation]
nec = 4
range = touch
duration = special
desc = Virutally identical to the Cleric or Magic-User spell AnimateDead, this spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The Necromancer may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to three times their caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly-intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly-intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. The caster may control no more hit dice of undead than 6 times their level.//Usage: `!cast reanimation sk5 zo3` would summon 5 skeletons and 3 zombies.

[RotFlesh]
nec = 4
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell works exactly like the DecayFlesh spell, save that it deals 2d6 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level to the creature affected by it. The caster must make a successful attack to inflict the damage. A missed attack roll does not dispel the effect, as it can be active until used or a number of rounds equal to the cater's level have passed.//Just like in the lower level DecayFlesh spell, this spell may not be reversed, and similarly, this spell works upon undead creatures in the opposite fashion; they are healed for 2d6 plus 1 point per caster level worth of damage instead.

[SpiritWrack]
nec = 3
range = special
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to any one particular incorporeal undead being such as wraiths, spectres, ghosts, or similar entities within sight of the caster. Alternatively, the caster may choose to cause a burst of 1d4 points of damage per level to any such beings within 20 feet of the caster, whether visible or not. Minor spiritual beings such as poltergeists haunting an area are usually destroyed outright by this spell. Any affecting being is allowed a save for half damage.//Some persistent types of undead may reform after the passage of time (typically days later), and may require certain rituals or other requirements be fulfilled before being permanently destroyed. This spell only affects true incorporeal undead and does nothing against other types of beings, even if they happen to be insubstantial at the time; vampires that happen to be in gaseous form are immune to this spell's effect.

[Stench]
nec = 1
range = self
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell creates a sickly stinking smell of rot and decay that emanates from the caster's body. The stench duplicates the sickening effect of ghasts: Living creatures must succeed on a save vs. Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). For every three levels the caster has, a penalty of -1 on the save is applied to those affected (at 3rd the save is at -1, at 6th level at -2, at 9th level at -3, etc). A NeutralizePoison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.

[SummonSpirit]
nec = 3
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1tlvl
desc = Upon casting this spell, a malevolent spirit in the form of a wraith is called to serve the caster for 1 turn per level. If the caster is 10th level they may choose between 1d4 wraiths or one spectre. At 15th level the caster may opt to summon 2d4 wraiths, 1d3 spectres, or one ghost. The summoned spirits will serve according to its ability, usually by combating the caster's foes, and generally disappearing at the end of the spell's duration.//Occasionally the spirit does not depart at the end of the spell duration, but simply becomes free of the compulsion to serve and will usually attack the caster. The chance is 5 percent for any particular wraith, 10 percent for spectres, and 20 percent for a ghost. When this occurs, the spirit will remain in the area for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level before departing. A spirit with less than half its hit points will not stay regardless. The caster would be wise to have protections or contingencies against the rogue spirits.//Usage: `!cast summonspirit [wraith|spectre|ghost] (or leave blank for random`

[SymbolofFear]
nec = 6
range = special
duration = special
desc = This spell functions like SymbolofPain, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the symbol of fear become panicked for 1 round per caster level. A panicked creature will drop whatever it is holding and flee using any means necessary. If cornered, the creature will cower in fear. The victim will also suffer a -2 to all saving throws. If a save is made, the victim is still shaken and suffers -2 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1 round.

[SymbolofPain]
nec = 5
range = special
duration = special
desc = With this spell, the caster writes a potent rune on a surface. When triggered, each creature within 60 feet of the symbol of pain are wracked with pain. This pain imposes a -4 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. These effects last for as long as the creature stays within range of the symbol, and for 1 hour after leaving the area.//Once triggered, the symbol will remain active for 1 turn (60 rounds) per caster level. After that the symbol is discharged. A symbol is permanent until discharged; it may be removed by DispelMagic that targets the rune specifically.//The symbol is triggered by one or more of the following, as determined by the caster: a victim looks at the rune, reads the rune, touches the rune, or passes near the rune. Regardless of the triggering methods, it cannot be triggered by a creature more than 60 feet away. Once the spell is cast, the trigger methods cannot be changed.//Triggering methods can be further modified by qualifiers, type of creature, race of creature, number of creatures, skip some number of triggers (so it is the third creature to touch it, not the first or second), or any other qualifier that is based on observable actions or details.//The symbol may also be assigned a password that will temporarily disable the symbol when the password is said as a creature enters the range of the symbol. Each time the range is entered, the password must be said again or the symbol will go off. This is set at the time of casting and cannot be changed.

[Undeath]
nec = 6
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = As a vile necromantic alternative to the Reincarnation spell, this spell can be used to bring back individuals to the world of the living. Upon casting this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or creature) in an undead state, whether as some sort of reanimated body or as a spiritual or ghost-like form. Wicked, cruel, murderous, or so-called evil beings will often want to continue their predations in undeath, but for most beings the subject's soul is not willing to return in such a state. Most normal individuals roll a saving throw vs. Spells to avoid coming back (roll as if they were still alive and well), and if successful the spell fails completely as the soul cannot be compelled to return.//Roll on the following table to determine what sort of undead creature the character becomes.//d100 • Undead Form//01-25 • Ghoul//26-40 • Ghast//41-50 • Mummy//51-55 • Spectre//56-60 • Vampire//61-75 • Wight//76-84 • Wraith//85-90 • Ghost//91-00 • Other (GM's choice)//Since the dead character is returning in a state of undeath, all physical ills and afflictions are generally irrelevant. The condition of the remains is not really a factor so long as the body is largely intact. The magic of the spell repairs or otherwise accomodates any changes necessary to conform to the new undead state, the process taking one hour to complete. When the spell is finished, the new undead being becomes aware and active. The caster has absolutely no special control over the newly-'risen' being. Of course, subsequent spells may be cast, having completely normal effects upon the new undead.//The newly-undead character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (but see below). The physical abilities of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution should be re-rolled or determined by the parameters of the new form. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1 (not a negative level, a real reduction - cannot be magically restored). The subject of this spell takes on all the abilities, hindrances, and disadvantages of the new undead state, having either the undead creature's normal hit dice or will have hit points according to the character's reduced level, whichever is higher. In either case, the character's class abilities are available to the newly-risen form excepting any obviously contracting situations. For instance, Climbing is probably of little importance to a ghost-like form.//The spell can thus create generally-superior undead beings who often go on to lead others of their kind. The undead creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but also must confront any special tendencies of the new state. For instance, a newly-risen ghoul hungers voraciously for fetid flesh, and a new vampire thirsts for blood. The compulsions of the undead are very strong, and the behaviors will soon overcome any previous relationships with living beings, although it may experience remorse over killing its former friends. For undead such as ghouls, ghasts, and wights, refusing to kill and feed gives a -6 to Intelligence and Wisdom scores.//Constructs, elementals, and similar creatures cannot become undead. The creature must have originally been a living corporeal being with some semblance of intelligence. The GM has the final say whether this spell affects any specific being. Likewise the GM decides any special situations or special manifestations that may occur from the use of this spell. Generally, any character who becomes an undead immediately becomes an NPC under the control of the GM unless he or she has made special accomodations to allow for undead player characters.

[UndeathtoDeath]
nec = 6
cle = 6
range = 240
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell functions exactly as DeathSpell, except that it affects undead creatures rather than living creatures.

[VampiricTouch]
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = 1rlvl
desc = The caster must make an attack roll. If successful, the caster deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. The caster gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. If the attack kills the target, the caster only gains as many temporary hit points as it took to kill the target, not the full number rolled. The temporary hit points will last for 1 hour.

[WallofBones]
nec = 4
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 1rlvl
desc = An immobile wall of writhing interlocking bone and bone fragments rises from the earth. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, 1 foot thick, per caster level. Unlike the similar spell, WallofStone, the caster may not double the wall's area by halving its thickness, as the structure is arleady very porous and would lose its structural integrity, but of course the wall can be made thicker. For instance, a 10th-level caster could conjure a section to fill in a 10-foot cube (10 feet x 10 feet x 1 foot, 10 sections thick). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall does not require concentration to maintain, but falls to pieces at the end of the spell duration.//The spell also differs from WallofStone in that the semi-animated wall attacks those within close proximity to its structure (10 feet) for 2d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (chosen randomly) from the bones. The structure is not completely solid, so high-strength individuals may attempt to break through with a Strength check, but they take an additional 2d6+1/level points of damage while making the attempt for each 1 foot of thickness that they attempt to move through. The bone wall does not attack the caster or any undead creatures. The wall of bones may be fashioned into simple structures such as ramps or bridges to span a rift, but these uses reduce the size by half so that supporting arches or buttresses can be included.

[WavesofFatigue]
nec = 5
range = 30
duration = 1tlvl

desc = This cantrip may change a small object (up to 27 cubic inches) into another shape, size, color, or texture. Radical changes, such as creating small living things, are not apt to last more than one turn (60 rounds), but minor changes (such as coloring a head of hair bright pink) may stay as long as a month. "Related" changes, such as creating a baby hedgehog from a pincushion, may last longer than non-related ones (such as changing a book into a lizard).
mt = 0

[Bolster]

[ArcaneDagger]
mu = 0
fm = 0
il = 0
nec = 0
sp = 0
desc = An arcane dagger is a glowing, blade-like shard of magical energy. It is treated as a normal missile weapon, with an attack roll against the target's normal AC. The spellcaster adds their normal attack bonus as well as any Intelligence bonus and applies normal adjustments for range (short 10', medium 20', long 30'). On a successful hit the arcane dagger inflicts 1d4 points of damage. At first level the dagger is treated as being equivalent to an ordinary weapon. At 4th level it is as if it were a silvered weapon, and at 8th level it is as if it were a magic weapon. This attack can affect inanimate objects. An arcane dagger disappears after being used; no debris is left behind.
mt = 0

[ArcaneBlast]
mu = 0
fm = 0
il = 0
nec = 0
sp = 0
desc = This is a bolt of raw magic with a range of 30 feet which inflicts 1d4 points of damage. No roll is required to launch an arcane blast, but the target may save vs. Death Ray to avoid all damage. Since it is pure magic, it will affect creatures which are only affected by magical weapons, but like a MagicMissile it does not affect inanimate objects. At 6th level the damage is increased to 2d4, and at 12th level the range increases to 60 feet.
mt = 0

[ArcaneDart]

This attack has a range of 30 feet and inflicts 1d4 points of damage; it affects creatures only affected by magical weapons, but not inanimate objects, much like the spell MagicMissile. At 9th level the range increases to 60 feet.
mt = 0

[Alarm]
mu = 1
fm = 1
il = 1
sp = 1
range = 20
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = 2hlvl
desc = Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time any creature larger than a rat enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the caster at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. The caster decides at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.//Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the caster (and only the caster) so long as he or she remains within 1 mile of the warded area. The caster will hear a single mental "ping" sufficient to awaken the caster from normal sleep, but which does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.//Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 ft of the warded area can hear it clearly. Interposing doors or walls may reduce the distance by 10 ft or 20 ft. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing.//Incorporeal creatures do not trigger the alarm.
mt = 1
nec = 1

[AstralProjection]
cle = 7
mu = 7
fm = 7
il = 7
mt = 7
range = self
duration = special
desc = This spell frees the caster's spirit (or soul) from his or her body, allowing it to travel to another plane. The caster may bring along up to one other creature per two caster levels as long as all participants are linked in a circle when the spell is cast.//The participants' spirits are immediately transported to the destination plane where they form a new body. This new body will appear to be exactly the same as their original body, but will be acclimated to survive on this new plane. They will also have clothing and equipment identical to what they were wearing when the spell was cast, though only exceptional magic items will be duplicated; most magic items will be replaced with normal items. This spell leaves the participants' original bodies in suspended animation.//This spell will last indefinitely. It will end when the caster chooses to end the spell or when the caster's new body dies. In either case, all of the new bodies pop out of existence, and the participants' spirits return to their original bodies. If a participant other than the caster wills it, or their new body dies, they return on their own, leaving the others behind. If the original body of anyone who is still under the effects of the spell is killed, the character is killed and their new body pops out of existence.//Unlike Gate, the destination cannot be the same plane as the plane of origin. Also, AstralProjection cannot be cast while still in the new body. To go to a different plane, the caster must end the spell, bringing everyone back to their original bodies, and cast a new spell from their original bodies.

[Barkskin]
dru = 2
range = self
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The caster's skin turns hard and bark-like, giving the caster a +4 bonus to AC. No actual bulk is added to the caster, so it doesn't affect other spell casting.

[CallHorseman]
nec = 7
range = 20
duration = special
desc = This spell calls forth a headless horseman which is subsequently given a task to accomplish, such as the slaying of one individual. The skull of an appropriately leveled warrior (of the mounted variety) is required to complete the summoning. The maximum level of the summoned headless horseman is equal to the caster's level or the actual level of the horseman at the time of his or her death (whichever is lowest). Thus the aspiring summoner usually works to get the most powerful warrior available, often by arranging the death of the warrior.//Each horseman is an individual and usually appears in knightly garb similar to what they wore in life. A jack-o-lantern may appear in lieu of their actual head, or a ghost-like vestige, a vacant helmet or hood, or other variations on this theme. The mount of the horseman is always summoned alongside its master.//The summoner must have possession of the actual skull of the horseman in order to maintain control over him. If possession of the skull is lost, the horseman will attempt to gain possession of the skull with all the same fervor of his appointed task. If successful, the horseman may become free-willed or simply vanish (GM's discretion). The spell can only be cast during the night (even if summoned underground), and the horseman (and mount) remains until the task is complete or the sun rises. The spell must be recast the following night if the task was left unfinished or the horseman is slain while on task.

[Censure]
cle = 1
range = 30
duration = instantaneous
desc = The cleric casting this spell utters a condemnation of the target's behavior or conduct; the spell then creates a point of divine energy, which the cleric directs at the target. The cleric must roll to hit, and if he or she misses then the spell has no effect. If the target is hit, then roll as below://1d6 • Outcome//1 • Stunned for 1d4+1 rounds//2-3 • Paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds//4-5 • Move slowed by half for 1d4+1 rounds//6 • Number of attacks reduced by half for 1d4+1 rounds//This spell affects only living creatures, and is ineffective against opponents having 7 or more hit dice or levels.
pa = 1

[Changestaff]
dru = 7
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell transforms a specially prepared staff into a treant-like creature. The creature looks and fights just like a treant, and will follow all directions given by the caster. The creature is not an actual treant, and so cannot talk to other treants or animate trees. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it disintegrates and the staff is destroyed. If the duration expires, or the caster ends the spell early, the creature transforms back into the staff.//The staff must be a specially prepared quarterstaff made from ash, oak, or yew. It must be finished using a special process requiring a full week.

[Clairaudience]
mu = 3
fm = 3
il = 3
mt = 3
range = 60
duration = 12t
desc = This spell enables the caster to hear sounds in another area through the ears of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60 feet away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn (60 rounds) has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.

[Command]
cle = 1
range = 10
duration = 1r
desc = The caster speaks a single-word command which will be obeyed by a single creature within the given range. The command must be given in a language the recipient understands. The recipient will do its best to obey, as long as the command is a clear, imperative verb. "Die" would cause the recipient to fake death for the duration of the spell (believing it was dead). Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, fly, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc.//Undead are not affected. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 or more and creatures with 6 or more hit dice may save vs. Spells to resist.
pa = 1

[ControlWeather]
cle = 7
dru = 7
range = special
duration = 4d12h
desc = The caster can change the weather in the local area. Any kind of weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area may be invoked. It takes 10 minutes for the weather to change to the desired conditions. For the duration of the spell, the caster may again change the conditions, but any such change will take another 10 minutes for the new conditions to arrive.//The caster has control over the general conditions of the weather, such as the direction and force of the winds, whether the lightning is occurring, whether there is a tornado, and other directives. But there is no specific control, so lightning cannot be forced to hit a particular spot and the path of a tornado cannot be dictated.//The spell allows the caster to remove conditions as well as bring them. (For example, an existing tornado can be replaced with calm weather.) At the end of the spell, the current conditions will continue, the caster just won't be able to control them anymore.

[CreepingDoom]
dru = 7
range = 300
rngeperlvl = 30
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This is a more powerful form of InsectPlague. It summons one swarm of centipedes per two caster levels, to a maximum of ten swarms at 20th level. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one continuous area. The caster may summon the centipede swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms may be directed to move after being summoned.//Centipede swarms act as insect swarms, but have 8 HD, do 2d6 points of damage, have a moment rate of 20 feet, and cannot fly.

[CureDeafness]
cle = 3
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = With this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering deafness, whether caused by injury or by magic. Deafness caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell. The cure is permanent but does nothing to prevent subsequent events leading to deafness again.

[DelayedBlastFireball]
mu = 7
fm = 7
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = special
desc = This spell creates a small glowing bead at any location chosen by the caster within range. The bead will explode in an improved form of Fireball at a time chosen by the caster; when it explodes, it will do 1d6+1 damage per caster level to all within a spherical volume with a 20' radius, just as with the standard fireball spell. The bead may explode immediately if the caster so desires, or may be delayed up to 10 rounds; the caster chooses the time when the spell is cast, and it cannot subsequently be changed.//If a delay is chosen, the glowing bead lies at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead (with the same range as a dagger); if the bead is handled within 1 round of its scheduled detonation, there is a 1 in 1d4 chance that the bead detonates instantly; i.e. before it can be thrown.

[Demand]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = 50
duration = 1dlvl
desc = The caster imposes on a target creature by issuing a demand for a course of activity limited to a sentence or two. The demand may be phrased in any way desired, though wording it in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable increases the chance of success. The demand may be for something risky or dangerous, but a demand to directly kill themselves automatically negates the effect of the spell.//The demanded course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the demanded activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes the activity. The caster can specify conditions that will trigger an activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.//If the recipient creature makes its saving throw vs. Spells, the spell has no effect. A reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (up to -4 depending on how persuasive) and a dangerous activity causes the save to be made with a bonus (up to +4 for something hopeless).//The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the demand, i.e. it must be spoken in a language which the spell recipient understands. Undead are not subject to Demand.

[Disjunction]
sp = 7
range = 25
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster chooses an item or creature within the spell's range and it is disjoined. All spells and spell-like effects are stripped from the item or creature, and any magic items will be changed back into a normal item. Any item or creature is entitled to a saving throw vs. Spells to negate the effect of the spell.//The spell can also be used to dismiss an Anti-MagicShell as long as the caster level of Disjunction is greater than the caster level of the Anti-MagicShell.//An artifact can be affected by Disjunction, though there is only a 1 percent chance per caster level of the spell succeeding (this percentage is used in place of a saving throw). If successful, there is a further 25 percent chance that the caster will permanently lose all magical ability. If the caster loses all magical ability, no mortal power can restore it, not even a wish. Destroying an artifact is a dangerous business, and it is almost guaranteed that a very powerful being associated with the artifact will take notice of its destruction.

[DominateConstruct]
sp = 7
range = 30
duration = special
desc = This spell allows the caster to take control of a construct, such as a golem. Control is absolute and the construct can be ordered to perform even self-destructive actions. An unintelligent construct gets no saving throw, and the duration is permanent. An intelligent construct gets a saving throw vs. Spells to avoid control. The intelligent construct is allowed a new saving throw each day to break free of the caster's control. Once control is released, an unintelligent construct will return to its programming as best is possible. When control is lost on an intelligent construct, it will know it has been controlled against its will.//Only one construct can be controlled at a time. If the caster already has a construct under control when this spell is cast again, control is immediately released on the prior construct in order to establish control on the new construct.//Add `-un` flag for unintelligent constructs. Example: `!cast dominateconstruct go1 -un`

[Earthquake]
cle = 7
dru = 7
range = 400
rngeperlvl = 40
duration = 1r
desc = When cast, this spell causes a powerful, but localized, earthquake that is 10 feet in diameter per caster level. The shock of the quake will knock down creatures, topple plants, collapse structures, open cracks in the earth, and more. The effect lasts for one round, during which the creatures in the affected area cannot move or act. The earthquake affects everything touching the ground in the affected area. The specific effect depends on the type of terrain where the spell is cast://- Cave, cavern, tunnel: Causes the roof to collapse, causing 8d6 damage to everyone in the affected area (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble. Small rooms and tunnels become completely filled.//- Cliff: Causes a landslide. Any creatures in the path take 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble.//- Open ground: All creatures in the area must save vs. Petrify or fall to the ground. Fissures open up and all creatures have a 1 in 1d4 chance of falling in (save vs. Death Ray to avoid). After the end of the spell, the fissures close up, killing anything that fell in.//- Structures: Any structures directly touching the affected ground take 100 points of damage, ignoring hardness. If this causes the structure to collapse, anyone trapped inside takes 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half) and is pinned beneath the rubble.//- River, lake, marsh: Fissures in the bottom drain the water away, resulting in a muddy quicksand-like surface to remain. All creatures in the affected area must save vs. Death Ray or be stuck. After the end of the spell, the surrounding water rushes back in, potentially drowning any creatures stuck in the mud.//Any creature pinned by rubble takes 1d6 points of non-lethal damage per minute until rescued or until they fall unconscious. Once unconscious, they take 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute until they are rescued or die.

[FingerofDeath]
nec = 7
range = 60
duration = instantaneous
desc = The caster points their finger at one creature, who must then save vs. Death Ray or instantly die. If they make their saving throw, they still take 3d6 points of damage, +1 damage per caster level.//This spell only affects living creatures and does not affect non-living creatures such as constructs or undead.

[FireStorm]
cle = 7
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell causes an area 20'x10'x10' per caster level to be filled with holy fire. The caster can determine the shape of the area, but the entire area must be contiguous. Any creature in the designated area takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level that bypasses any immunity or resistance to fire. Any creature that dies from the damage (or was already dead when the storm is cast) is completely consumed by the fire. The fire only harms creatures and does not affect the surrounding environnment.

[GaseousForm]
mu = 3
fm = 3
sp = 3
range = touch
duration = 1mlvl
desc = The subject of this spell and all of their gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. He or she becomes immune to non-magical weapons, and has an Armor Class of 22 vs. magical weapons. The subject cannot attack or cast spells while in gaseous form. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10 feet, and can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, as long as the spell persists. The gaseous creature is subject to the effects of wind, and can't enter water or other liquid. Objects cannot be manipulated in this form, even those brought along when the spell was cast. The subject can resume material form at will, but that will end the spell.

[Gate]
cle = 7
mu = 7
fm = 7
sp = 7
range = 120
duration = special
desc = This spell creates an inter-dimensional connection between the caster's location and another plane. This allows for travel between the two locations in either direction. The gate stays open as long as the caster concentrates on it, up to 1 round per caster level, plus one additional round.//The gate appears as a flat circle with a diameter of 5 to 20 feet (caster's choice). It can be situated at any angle, but will usually be vertical. The back (the side facing away from the caster) is filled with an insubstantial opaque haze and passing through does nothing. The front shows where the gate is connected. This is a full opening between locations with complete visibility (subject to the conditions on the other side; from a place in the air to a place in the water will get expected results) and acecssibility. The gate is full two-way, and anyone on either side can pass back and forth either way, including going one way and back the other as long as the gate stays open. Any number of people or things can use the gate, subject to the spell's duration and normal physical constraints. When the spell expires (or if the caster ends or loses concentration) it goes away, but can always be recreated by casting the spell again.//Note that the spell will allow both sides to be on the same plane if so desired, and that means it can also work as a very powerful alternative to teleportation.//As long as the destination is known and exists as known, the gate will open where desired. If not, the gate will open in a random location on the plane (i.e. wherever the GM wants it to). Some extraordinary creatures, at the GM's discretion, are powerful enough to detect that a gate is opening on their plane.

[GentleRepose]
cle = 2
nec = 3
range = touch
duration = 1dlvl
desc = This spell preserves the remains of a dead creature (including a zombie, if so desired). This prevents any decay of the remains for the duration of the spell. This extends the time limit imposed by RaiseDead, allowing for a longer time to cast the spells.
pa = 2

[Goodberry]
dru = 1
range = touch
duration = 1dlvl
desc = This spell, when cast on a bush or tree, causes it to sprout a handful of berries, 2d4 of which are magical. The caster (and any Druid of 3rd level or greater) can immediately recognize which are magical. Eating a magical berry provides the equivalent of a full meal to a human (or similar creature) and heals 1 point of damage. No one can heal more than 8 points of damage using these berries in a single day.

[GreaterTeleport]
mu = 7
fm = 7
range = self
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell functions in a similar fashion to the normal Teleport spell, except that there is no limit to the range that can be spanned, nor is there any chance of arriving off target. In addition, the caster need not have seen the destination, if he or she has at least a reliable description of it. If the caster attempts to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), he or she disappears and then reappears in the original location. This spell cannot transport the caster to another plane of existence.

[HolyWord]
cle = 7
range = 30
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell represents the most powerful word of any cleric's purest faith. When uttered, the cleric pulses with a blinding radiance and all enemies of the cleric within a 30' radius that can hear him suffer 1d6 points of damage per level of the cleric. Because of the searing light emanating from him, each enemy within range that can see the cleric must make a save vs. Spells or be blinded. Creatures struck dead by this spell burst into fierce flames and burn down to a fine ash within a single round.

[Insanity]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = The target of this spell must save vs. Spells or be permanently under the effects of the Confusion spell. The only way to remove this condition is through the use of Heal, restoration, or a wish. (RemoveCurse or DispelMagic will not remove this condition.) If the save is made, the confusion still lasts for 2 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

[Longevity]
mu = 7
fm = 7
nec = 7
sp = 7
range = self
duration = permanent
desc = This spell will halt the aging process in the caster for 1d4+1 years. During this period, the caster's physical appearance and general health remain as they were at the time of casting, as if he or she has not aged a day. Aging attacks, such as those from a ghost, subtract from the Longevity years first before actually aging the victim. Because of the tremendous magical strain of this spell on the body and soul, a caster can only benefit from it once every 5 years. Casting this spell requires a bloodstone gem of at least 2000 GP in value, which is consumed in the casting.

[MageArmor]
mu = 1
fm = 1
sp = 1
range = self
duration = 1t
desc = The caster's skin becomes hard and stone-like, giving the caster a +2 bonus to armor class vs. melee attacks and hand-thrown missiles such as daggers or spears, and a +4 bonus to armor class vs normal-sized projectiles such as arrows, bolts, sling stones, and sling bullets.

[MajorCreation]
sp = 7
range = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell creates a non-magical object of non-living matter. The volume of the creation cannot exceed 1 cubic yard per caster level. The object can be a complex, composite object, as long as the caster knows how to build the object using mundane means. A simple object (e.g. a sword or staff) can be of high quality. Multiple simple objects of average quality can be created with one casting as long as they all easily fit within the stated volume.

[PlaneShift]
cle = 5
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = When cast, the caster or the creature touched is sent to another plane or dimension. If multiple creatures link hands in a circle, up to eight may plane shift. All participants must be willing. If any intended participant is unwilling, the spell fails with no effect. PlaneShift is highly inaccurate and while the desired plane or dimension will always be reached, arrival will be 1d100 miles away from the intended destination.

[PowerWordStun]
mu = 7
fm = 7
nec = 7
range = 120
duration = special
desc = The caster utters a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of his or her choice to become stunned, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total. Any creature that currently has 71 or more hit points is unaffected. If the target has between 36 and 70 hit points, the duration is 1d6 rounds. If the target has 35 hit points or less, the duration is 2d6 turns (a turn is 60 rounds).

[PrismaticSpray]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = 60
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell causes seven beams of brilliant, intertwined colored light to shoot from the caster's hands covering a cone-shaped area. All creatures in the area of effect will be struck by one or two beams. (A given beam may strike more than one creature or potentially no creatures.) A saving throw vs. Spells will negate the effect of a beam for the struck creature. (A creature struck by two beams must make two saving throws.)//Any creatures in the affected area that are 8 HD or less are blinded for 2d4 rounds with no saving throw.//1d8 • Color • Effect (Saving throw)//1 • Red • 20 points of fire damage (Death Ray for half)//2 • Orange • 40 points of acid damage (Death Ray for half)//3 • Yellow • 80 points of electricity damage (Death Ray for half)//4 • Green • Poison (Poison or die)//5 • Blue • Turned to stone (Petrify)//6 • Indigo • Insanity, as the Insanity spell (Spells)//7 • Violet • Teleport 5d100 miles away (Spells)//8 • Struck by two rays; roll two more times, ignoring 8.

[Quench]
dru = 3
range = 200
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell covers one cube 20' per side, per caster level. Within this area, all non-magical fires are immediately extinguished. Any magical fires are extinguished, but must be dispelled as if this was DispelMagic.//If cast on a fire elemental, the fire elemental takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level with no save.//If cast on a single magic item that creates or controls fire, the item loses its fire-related abilities for 1d4 hours.

[RemoveParalysis]
cle = 2
nec = 2
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell permits the caster to free the creature touched from paralysis induced either by magical means or by monster attack (e.g. venom or ghouls).
pa = 2

[RepelWood]
dru = 6
range = 60
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This spell creates a flow of energy in a direction the caster sets when the spell is cast. All wooden objects are then pushed away in that direction for the duration of the spell. Any wooden object greater than three inches in diaemter that is fully anchored in place will resist the spell. Any wooden object three inches in diameter or less that is anchored will shatter, and its pieces will be pushed away. All affected objects are pushed at a speed of 40 feet per round.//Any objects that are carried will push their bearer unless dropped or released. Any spear braced against the spell will shatter. Even magic items with wooden components are pushed away.//Once the spell is cast, the path of the flow of energy is set and the caster does not need to do anything to maintain it.

[RestoreHealth]
cle = 2
dru = 2
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell removes unnatural weakness, mental or physical exhaustion or debilitation from the touched individual. This spell is useful for restoring temporary ability score draining, such as the strength-draining touch of a shadow. The caster chooses which ability score the spell will restore when casting. It has no effect on permanent ability score loss or energy drain.//Usage: `!cast restorehealth [target?] [stat]`
pa = 2

[Resurrection]
cle = 7
range = touch
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell restores life to a deceased creature. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than ten years per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.//This spell operates similarly to RaiseDead, but more powerful. The full body is not required; only a small portion is required, but that portion must have been part of the subject's body at the time of death. (The dust left from a Disintegrate spell counts as the required small portion.) A whole new body is created, so it will be at the peak of health, with full hit points, and all spells prepared at the time of death.//This is still an ordeal, however. The subject of the spell loses one level (or hit die) when it is resurrected, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can't be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.//A creature which has become undead can be resurrected as long as the undead creature has been destroyed. Constructs and elementals cannot be resurrected.//The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

[RevealMagic]
mu = 6
fm = 6
sp = 6
range = 5
duration = 1m
desc = This spell reveals all spell and magical properties of an object, creature, or permanently enchanted area examined with this spell. The caster must examine the object, creature, or location for an entire minute. In the case of a magic item, the caster will learn all of its functions, how to activate it (if required), and any charges left (if it has charges). If it is an object or creature with spells cast on it, or an enchanted area, the caster will learn what spells, their effects, and the caster level of those spells.//Any object or magic item that is held by someone who does not want the object or magic item examined may negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells. Likewise a creature that does not want to be examined may also negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells.

[RingofGreaterHealing]
cle = 7
dru = 7
range = self
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster to create an effect similar to the spell CureSeriousWounds affecting multiple creatures within a 15ft radius. This spell thus cures 3d6+3 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.

[RingofLesserHealing]
cle = 5
dru = 5
range = self
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell CureLightWounds affecting multiple creatures within a 15ft radius. This spell thus cures 1d6+1 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels. If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing. Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.

[Sanctuary]
cle = 1
range = self
duration = 2rplus1lvl
desc = This spell causes opponents to ignore the caster. Any opponent who might otherwise wish to attack or harm the caster must make a successful saving throw vs. Spells in order to do so; if this save fails, that opponent will behave as if the caster is not important and move on to whatever activity it would normally do if he or she were not present. This spell does not prevent area effect attacks (Fireball, IceStorm, etc.) from harming the caster. While under protection from the spell, the caster is unable to perform any offensive acts, but may take any other action desired.
pa = 1

[ScintillatingPattern]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = 60
duration = special
desc = This spell is similar to ColorCloud. It causes an area of vivid, twisting, discordant colors, causing creatures in the area of effect to become blinded or possibly unconscious. The area covers 20 feet on each side. Each creature within the cloud is affected according to its hit dice://- 6 HD or less: The creature is unconscious for 2d4 rounds, then blinded for 1d4 rounds, then confused for 1d4 rounds.//- 7 to 9 HD: The creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds, then confused for 1d4 rounds.//10 or more HD: The creature is blinded and confused simultaneously for 1 round.//Confused creatures act as if under the effects of the Confusion spell.//All creatures having more levels or hit dice than the spell caster are entitled to a save vs. Spells to negate the effect. Sightless creatues are not affected.

[Screen]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = touch
duration = 24h
desc = This spell combines elements of several other illusion spells to protect against both divination and direct observation. The caster dictates what the illusion is and what will and will not be seen by any observers. The illusion is described in general terms and once set cannot be changed. The illusion is not static and the general terms must describe how the illusion changes over time. The area covered is a 30 ft cube per caster level.//Any divination attempts of the area will see the illusion described. There is no saving throw to prevent this.//Any direct observation can allow for a saving throw vs. Spells to disbelieve. Entering the area does not cancel the illusion, or even allow a save, as long as the observer does not run into anything that is incongruous and hidden creatures stay out of the observer's way.

[Shades]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = 30
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell summons a shade creature. A shade creature is the same as a shadow monster from the Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules, except that it has 9 HD and does 1d8 damage (cold), plus drains 1 point of strength. An opponent killed by strength damage will not rise as a new shade creature or shadow, but will merely be dead. A shade creature obeys the caster's orders without question and can understand the caster's language.

[Shillelagh]
dru = 1
range = touch
duration = 1mlvl
desc = This turns any club or staff wielded by the caster into a magical weapon with a +1 bonus to hit and to damage. The club or staff also does 1d8 points of damage instead of its normal damage. This spell only affects a weapon held by the caster. If the caster releases the weapon, the benefits no longer apply, but, if the caster retrieves the weapon prior to the end of the spell, the benefits result until the spell ends.

[Stoneskin]
dru = 5
mu = 5
fm = 5
sp = 5
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The caster's skin becomes hard and stone-like, protecting the caster by absorbing the first 10 points of damage from all attacks. Once the spell has absorbed 10 points of damage per caster level, the spell is discharged.

[Sword]
mu = 7
fm = 7
sp = 7
range = 30
duration = 1rlvl
desc = This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as the caster desires, beginning in the round that the spell is cast. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on the caster's normal initiative turn. The sword attacks as a fighter of the same level as the caster, and the attack roll is modified by the caster's Intelligence bonus. The sword inflicts 3d4 points of damage on a successful hit, and can hit even creatures immune to non-magical weapons. On a natural roll of 19 or 20, the attack will be a critical hit. The sword can only be destroyed by a successful application of DispelMagic.

[SymbolofDeath]
nec = 7
range = special
duration = special
desc = This spell functions like SymbolofPain, except that all creatures within 60 ft of the symbol of death instead must save vs. Spells or die. If the saving throw is made, the creature need not save again unless they leave the area of effect and then reenter while the symbol is still active.

[Tongues]
cle = 3
mu = 3
fm = 3
il = 3
mt = 3
nec = 3
sp = 3
range = touch
duration = 1tlvl
desc = This spell allows the creature touched to speak and understand any language or dialect. Only one language can be spoken at a time, but any number can be understood. This spell does not alter other creatures' dispositions and does not allow the affected creature to speak to creatures that cannot understand language.

[TransmuteMetaltoWood]
dru = 7
range = 200
rngeperlvl = 20
duration = instantaneous
desc = The spell affects a circular area with a diameter of 10 ft per caster level. All metal objects within the area are changed to wood. This applies to all metal items, whether worn (including weapons and armor), laying around, used as building materials, or anywhere. Magic items made of metal may save vs. Spells to avoid the transmutation. Artifacts are not affected. Ordinary items (whether held or worn or not) do not get a saving throw.//Weapons converted from metal to wood take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor class of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor class every time it is struck with an attack roll of 19 or 20.//Only a wish can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state.

[Tree]
dru = 2
range = self
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell allows the caster to assume the form of a tree. The tree may be either a small living tree or shrub, or a large dead tree with few limbs. All inspection of the tree will show it to only be a tree, and even detect magic will return inconclusive results. While in the form of a tree, the caster can see and hear all around them and is fully aware of their environment. The caster’s hit points and saving throws are unchanged, and a +10 bonus to armor class is gained. All clothing and gear worn is transformed with the caster. The spell may be dismissed at any time prior to the end of the spell.

[UnseenServant]
mu = 1
fm = 1
il = 1
mt = 1
sp = 1
range = 50
duration = 1hlvl
desc = An unseen servant is an invisible servant that is shapeless and mindless. It can be used to fetch things, return things, open doors, hold chairs, clean things, and mend things. It is not strong, having an effective strength of 3. It can only open normal doors, chests, lids, containers, and such subject to its minimal strength. The servant cannot fight, nor can it be destroyed, but it can always be dismissed at any time prior to the spell’s end.

[Vision]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = special
duration = 1r
desc = This spell allows the caster to send a recipient a message through a vision. This works similar to the dream spell, but the recipient does not need to be asleep. When the spell is cast, the caster must identify the recipient in an unambiguous way. An image of whatever the caster desires then appears to the recipient in a vision only he or she can see then delivers the message. The message is purely one-way, and there is no opportunity for questions or interaction. The recipient does not need to be asleep when the message is delivered, and he or she will be overwhelmed by the message when they receive it (assuming they are awake). When the message is finished, the recipient will remember the message perfectly.//For the duration of the spell, both the caster and the recipient are helpless and completely unaware of their surroundings.

[Weird]
il = 7
mt = 7
range = 100
rngeperlvl = 10
duration = instantaneous
desc = This spell functions as PhantasmalKiller, except that it can have multiple targets. The spell can target as many creatures as desired as long as no two of them are further than 30 feet from each other.//Each target must save vs. Spells to disbelieve the phantasmal killer. If the saving throw is failed, the killer then touches the target, who must then save vs. Petrify or die from fear. Even if the target makes the second saving throw, they still take 3d6 points of damage.

[WindWalk]
cle = 7
range = touch
duration = 1hlvl
desc = This spell alters the substance of the caster’s body to a cloud-like vapor (as the gaseous form spell) and he or she can move through the air, potentially at great speed. Other creatures can be touched by the caster, which causes them to be affected by the spell, too, each of whom acts independently. Up to one additional person per three caster levels my be included in the spell.//While under the spell, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet, able to move any direction at any time. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round, but maneuverability becomes very poor. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.//For the duration of the spell, each participant may freely switch between its physical form and its vaporous form as desired, but each change takes five rounds. The caster can dismiss the spell at any time, either individually or for everyone at once.//For the last minute of the spell’s duration, a wind walker in vaporous form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

[WychlampAura]
mu = 7
fm = 7
nec = 7
sp = 7
range = self
duration = 1tlvl
desc = The caster of this spell will be sheathed in a pale, glowing aura which confers the effect of an Anti-MagicShell (as the spell). In addition, any magic cast upon or including the caster in its area of effect is affected as follows://Spells directly targeting the caster (like MagicMissile) will be deflected. Roll 1d6; on a 1-2, the magic is reflected back at the offending caster. Otherwise, it is deflected at a random target.//Area effect magic is altered as follows (roll 1d10)://1-2: Area of effect is doubled and damage is halved (if applicable).//3-4: Target point of the spell may be redetermined by the protected spellcaster.//5: Complete nullification of the incoming spell.//6: The incoming spell is unaffected.//7-8: Spell is randomly targeted as a grenade-like missile using the target point as the caster.//9-10: Area of effect is halved and amage is doubled (if applicable).//Magical attacks delivered by touch area always reflected back on the attacker.

[Mount]
fm = 1
mu = 1
range = 30
duration = 2hlvl
desc = This spell summons a riding horse or pony (caster's choice) to serve as a mount. The mount comes with a bit, bridle, and saddle.

;[ChillRay]
;class = Necromancer
;level = 2
;range = 60 ft
;rangeperlvl = +10/level
;duration = 1 round/level (Concentration)
;desc = You conjure a ray of numbing cold. Once per round (including immediately), you may strike one creature within range for 1d4+1 cold damage. The target must save vs. Paralysis (heat grants +2) or become **Chilled** (–1 to melee attack and melee damage rolls) for 1d6 rounds. The effect ends if concentration is broken.
