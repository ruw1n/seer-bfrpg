desc=Elves are a slender race, with both males and females standing around five feet tall and weighing around 130 pounds. Most have dark hair, with little or no body or facial hair. Their skin is pale, and they have pointed ears and delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful, with keen eyesight and hearing. Elves are typically inquisitive, passionate, self-assured, and sometimes haughty. Their typical lifespan is a dozen centuries or more.//Elves may become most classes excluding Barbarian and Assassin, and they are also able to take the combination classes of Fightermage (Fighter plus Magic-User) and Magethief (Thief plus Illusionist). Elves never roll larger than d6 for hit points, regardless of their class.//All Elves have Darkvision with a 60' range. They are so observant that they can find secret doors with even a cursory glance. Elves are immune to the paralyzing attack of ghouls, and are less likely to be surprised in combat.

desc=Half-elves are the result of crossbreeding between elves and humans. An average half-elf male stands around 5'6" in height, with females averaging an inch shorter. They have pointed ears, but their features tend to favor the human parent a bit more than the elf. Half-elves are well-tolerated by humans in most cases, but are often shunned by elven society.//Half-elves may become members of most classes excluding Barbarian and Assassin, and they can also access the combination classes like elves.//Half-elves have Darkvision with a 30' range. They can find secret doors as well as an elf, but do not find secret doors on a cursory examination as elves do. Half-elves gain a 5 percent bonus on experience points gained.

They are usually fair-skinned, often with ruddy cheeks. Halflings are remarkably rugged for their small size. They are dexterous and nimble, capable of moving quietly and remaining very still. They usually go barefoot. Halflings are typically outgoing, unassuming and good-natured. They live about a hundred years.//Halflings are unusually accurate with all sorts of ranged weapons, gaining a bonus to accuracy, and also a bonus to initiative die rolls, due to their quick wit and reactions.//In their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively, with a 90 percent chance of success. Even indoors, in dungeons or in non-preferred terrain, any halfling can `!hide` with 70 percent effectiveness, regardless of class.//Being a small race, Halflings cannot wield Large weapons at all (Greataxe, Longbow, Heavy Crossbow, Greatsword, Maul, Quarterstaff, Polearm) and must use Medium weapons with two hands, even if they can be used with one hand normally (Battleaxe, Shortbow, Light Crossbow, Longsword/Scimitar, Mace, Club/Cudgel/Walking Staff, Spear).

desc=Cavemen are a species closely related to Humans; they are shorter and stockier, and much more heavily muscled. They do not all actually live in caves. Whether they are actually less intelligent than "normal" humans or not is a matter of debate, but it is true that they do not have the facility for language that other human, demi-human, and humanoid races have. However, they do seem to be able to communicate basic information amongst themselves through complex grunts and vocalizations similar to what one might hear from the great apes.//Caveman Clerics and Druids are still able to vocalize their spells despite this language limitation, doing so in peculiar ways that are unrecognizable by other races.//Cavemen are wise in the ways of nature, and make for excellent Druids or Rangers, but they lack the ability to communicate or understand advanced concepts such as arcane spellcasting. Cavemen can 'learn' languages, but only rudimentary concepts are understood.//Cavemen are very attuned to their surroundings, and like Elves are seldom surprised, only being surprised on a 1 instead of a 1-2 on the 1d6 roll.

Gnolls are nocturnal carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. Gnoll Fighters are the most common, but they show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader. Gnolls may become arcane spellcasters, but shun the use of illusion magic. Gnolls are generally savage, brutish and cruel.//In its role as a scavenger, a gnoll is especially attuned to scent. A gnoll is able to identify individuals by scent alone. This powerful olfactory sense allows it to determine the presence of concealed or invisible creatures. Gnolls have Darkvision out to 60'. Gnolls may eat raw meat without any ill effects.

Its eyes are unusually bright and crafty-looking, varying in color from red to yellow. A goblin's skin color ranges from yellow to green to orange to red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather.//Crafty and mechanically inclined, a goblin notices secret doors as well as an Elf, and is able to detect slanting passages, traps, shifting walls, and new construction as well as a Dwarf (Noticing traps on a 1-2 on a 1d6). Like most dark-dwelling races, a Goblin has Darkvision out to 60'.//Being a small race, Goblins cannot wield Large weapons at all (Greataxe, Longbow, Heavy Crossbow, Greatsword, Maul, Quarterstaff, Polearm) and must use Medium weapons with two hands, even if they can be used with one hand normally (Battleaxe, Shortbow, Light Crossbow, Longsword/Scimitar, Mace, Club/Cudgel/Walking Staff, Spear).

A hobgoblin's eyes are yellowish or dark brown. Hobgoblins keep their weapons keenly polished and in good repair.//Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate Elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents. Hobgoblin deities reinforce this militaristic outlook, and their Clerics are able to favor additional weapons as a result, such as the Spear, BattleAxe and Longsword.//While not as mechanically-minded as normal goblins, a hobgoblin is still very alert, noticing secret doors as well as an Elf. Like most dark-dwelling races, a hobgoblin has Darkvision out to 60'.

Kobolds tend to perceive larger races as enemies, and are naturally distrustful when encountered. Regardless, kobolds are cunning foes. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds prefer to ambush and set up traps.//A kobold may become any class, excluding the combination classes. Kobolds are masters of trapworks and are otherwise very mechanically inclined. They notice secret doors as well as an Elf and traps as well as a Dwarf. Kobolds have Darkvision out to 90'.//Being a small race, Kobolds cannot wield Large weapons at all (Greataxe, Longbow, Heavy Crossbow, Greatsword, Maul, Quarterstaff, Polearm) and must use Medium weapons with two hands, even if they can be used with one hand normally (Battleaxe, Shortbow, Light Crossbow, Longsword/Scimitar, Mace, Club/Cudgel/Walking Staff, Spear).

Adult males can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds and are always very strong. Lizardmen are largely indifferent to other races, being primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but sound tactics.//Lizard men generally prefer professions associated with nature or survival. Lizardmen have trouble relating to most other races.//Lizardmen are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn, or 60 rounds).

Their hair and beards may be blond, brown, black, or sometimes red. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. The most noticeable features about a gnome from the standpoint of other races is their pointed ears and noses. They are renowned for their rapidly-changing moods, sometimes gruff and contrary, sometimes whimsical and humorous. They have a lifespan between two and three centuries long.//Gnomes are frail like elves, unable to roll higher than d6 for hit dice regardless of class. They are also small like halflings, unable to wield large weapons and needing to wield medium weapons in two hands. With respect to encumbrance, gnomes are equivalent to halflings.//Gnomes have the ability to see invisible creatures and objects within 30 feet. Such creatures and objects appear as strange magical glows in the shape of the creature or object. A Thief hiding in shadows, an invisible sprite, or a character wearing an elven cloak may all be detected in this way.

desc=Kenku are a race of disheveled, corvid-like people who hatch from eggs like birds do. They are taller than dwarves, but not taller than a human. They typically come in dark colors, with beaks they can use for loud caws, and sharp talon'd feet that click when they move. Kenku dwell in nests or aeries that are often built near human cities until they reach adulthood, when they set off on their own with bands of like-minded kenkus. They often dwell in human cities, running criminal enterprises and confidence schemes.//A Kenku's wings are disheveled and unusable for flight, though still allowing them to leap great heights with ease, easily clearing 15ft gaps. Their disheveled nature leads their body to being far more frail than other races, with their hitdie size only going up to a d6.//The most noticeable ability of a Kenku is their adept mimicry, allowing them to effortlessly mimic the sounds and voices of other creatures. This ability only copies sounds and voices, and doesn't prevent a creature from figuring out it's a mimicry through other means. Being adept at their own forms of deception, as well as their temperament against that which is holy, Kenku are often paranoid of other creatures they're unfamiliar with, giving them a bonus to their initiative rolls.

[Hopper]
desc=Hopper is the kenku's racial ability that lets it jump higher than normal races. While it doesn't allow for full flight, your disheveled wings do allow you to make 15ft jumps with ease. Wind and other environmental factors may change the distance you can clear with your wings, and how you may use them (Up to GM discretion).

[Mimicry]
desc=Mimicry is the kenku's racial ability that lets them copy the sounds and voices of other creatures effortlessly. This does not prevent a creature from distinguishing it's a mimicry of their voice through what you say, or seeing that you're the one speaking in the voice.

desc=Tabaxi are a race of cat-like humanoids. There are many rumors regarding their mysterious origin, but in truth they are members of an ancient and reclusive culture commonly found only in the jungles of Hepmonaland. Standing at around five feet tall and weighing around 110 pounds, short fur covers their bodies and they have a non-prehensile tail. The color and pattern of their fur can be that of any domesticated or wild cat. Tabaxi wear clothing, and adventuring tabaxi typically prefer lighter armor. They are quick and graceful, and have excellent eyesight, giving them Darkvision out to 60 feet. They are fiercely curious and sometimes have trouble controlling that impulse. Their average lifespan is about 80 years.//Their feline nature gives them soft paws to silence their movements, and sharp retractable claws that are excellent for clinging to ledges. Their claws are not long enough to cause grievous wounds, and as such may not be used as a natural weapon. Tabaxi can fall up to 20 feet without taking any damage, and any additional fall damage beyond that is halved. Due to their quick nature, tabaxi have improved saves against magic wands and dragon breath.

[Catfall]
desc=Catfall is the tabaxi's natural ability to land on their feet, just like a cat. The first 20 feet of fall damage from any fall are ignored, and any additional fall damage beyond that is halved.


[QuickLearner]
desc=QuickLearner is the racial ability that gives you more experience earned. For humans, it is 10 percent, and for half-elves, half-orcs and half-ogres, it is 5 percent.

[Darkvision]
desc=Darkvision is the ability to see in the dark without the aid of a torch or lantern. Darkvision is experienced in black, white and shades of gray. Different races have different darkvision maximums: half-elves and half-ogres have 30 feet, orcs, half-orcs, dwarves, elves, goblins, hobgoblins, gnolls and bugbears have 60 feet, and kobolds have 90 feet.

[SecretDoor]
desc=SecretDoor is the ability to detect secret doors more effectively. This is handled automatically through the `!door` command, which any character of any race has access to. Having this ability will increase the likelihood that a secret door is found.//Note that full-blooded elves, as well as goblins, hobgoblins and kobolds, can also detect secret doors with but a cursory glance: for elf/goblin/kobold/hobgoblin characters, you may roll `!door` when entering each room, and this does not count as your exploration turn's action.//For other races such as half-elf and those without this ability, you may roll `!door` as your character's action on an exploration turn.

[GhoulImmune]
desc=GhoulImmune is the elven racial ability to ignore the paralyzing effect of a ghoul or ghast's claw attacks. Keep in mind this does not make the elf immune to all paralyzing monster abilities, but it does defend against the spell GhoulishHands.

[Alert]
desc=Alert is the racial ability to be surprised less often. Surprise rolls are called by the GM with the `!surprise` command, and failing one means the monsters get the drop on you - this can often prove fatal.

[Frail]
desc=Frail is a racial "ability" that denotes that your character's race is especially frail, and may not roll higher than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class.

[Large]
desc=Large characters have increased hit die values (which determine HP), as well as +1 on the roll when opening stuck doors or performing other feats of Strength.

[Aim]
desc=Aim is the halfling racial ability which gives them greater accuracy, gaining a +1 to all attack rolls with ranged weapons.

[QuickWit]
desc=QuickWit is the halfling racial ability to react quickly to any danger, giving them a +1 on initiative rolls.

[ForestStealth]
desc=ForestStealth is the halfling racial ability that gives them automatic 90 percent success when hiding in any forest environment.

[Hide]
desc=Even when not hiding in a forest environment, a halfling gets an automatic 70 percent success with `!s hide`, the thief's "hide in shadows" ability, even if the halfling is not a thief or other class capable of using the hide skill!

[Small]
desc=Small races have lower carry weight thresholds (they get into 'heavy' weight and slower move speed more easily), as well as equipment restrictions. A small character must hold a longsword, mace, or battleaxe in two hands, and may not wield a greatsword, greataxe, maul, polearm, longbow, heavy crossbow, or quarterstaff. As such, the 'small' weapons such as warhammer, shortsword, handaxe and sling are ideal for small characters.

[ReactPlus]
desc=ReactPlus is the half-orc's racial ability to be received more amicably by others, whether monsters or men. Half-orcs make for natural diplomats as a result, very much unlike their full-blooded brethren.

[Scent]
desc=Scent is the gnoll's racial ability to detect hidden or invisible creatures with supernatural scent. This does not give the gnoll ability to see invisible creatures, and as such they will still have a -2 to attack rolls against them.

[Stonecunning]
desc=Stonecunning is the racial ability to detect slanting passages, shifting walls, new construction, and most importantly traps. This is handled automatically in the `!trap` command, which any race has access to regardless of having this ability. Having Stonecunning makes your character's race more effective at `!trap`, though there are other ways to increase this further, such as playing a Scout or Thief.

[Swim]
desc=Swim gives lizardmen a swim speed, as well as lets them hold their breath for a full turn (60 rounds) under water. Keep in mind wearing metal armor or carrying too much weight can still lead to drowning.

[Bite]
desc=Bite is the lizardman's racial ability to attack with a bite. Doing so is simple: `!a bite (target)` example: `!a bite go1`. Bites deal 1d6 + strength modifier in piercing damage. A lizardman fighter may specialize in their bite with `!spec bite`.

[SeeInvisible]
desc=SeeInvisible is the gnome's racial ability to naturally see any invisible creatures or objects within 30 feet. Such creatures and objects appear as strange magical glows in the shape of the creature or object. A Thief hiding in shadows, an invisible sprite, or a character wearing an elven cloak may all be detected in this way.
