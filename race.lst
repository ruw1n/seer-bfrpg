Their typical lifespan is a dozen centuries or more.//Elves may become most classes excluding Barbarian and Assassin, and they are also able to take the combination classes of Fightermage (Fighter plus Magic-User) and Magethief (Thief plus Illusionist). Elves never roll larger than d6 for hit points, regardless of their class.//All Elves have Darkvision with a 60' range. They are so observant that they can find secret doors with even a cursory glance. Elves are immune to the paralyzing attack of ghouls, and are less likely to be surprised in combat.

desc=Cavemen are a species closely related to Humans; they are shorter and stockier, and much more heavily muscled. They do not all actually live in caves. Whether they are actually less intelligent than "normal" humans or not is a matter of debate, but it is true that they do not have the facility for language that other human, demi-human, and humanoid races have. However, they do seem to be able to communicate basic information amongst themselves through complex grunts and vocalizations similar to what one might hear from the great apes.//Caveman Clerics and Druids are still able to vocalize their spells despite this language limitation, doing so in peculiar ways that are unrecognizable by other races.//Cavemen are wise in the ways of nature, and make for excellent Druids or Rangers, but they lack the ability to communicate or understand advanced concepts such as arcane spellcasting. Cavemen can 'learn' languages, but only rudimentary concepts are understood.//Cavemen are very attuned to their surroundings, and like Elves are seldom surprised.

desc=Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. An adult male gnoll is about 7' tall and weighs 300 pounds. Gnolls are nocturnal carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. Gnoll Fighters are the most common, but they show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader. Gnolls may become arcane spellcasters, but shun the use of illusion magic. Gnolls are generally savage, brutish and cruel.//In its role as a scavenger, a gnoll is especially attuned to scent. A gnoll is able to identify individuals by scent alone. This powerful olfactory sense allows it to determine the presence of concealed or invisible creatures. Gnolls have Darkvision out to 60'. Gnolls may eat raw meat without any ill effects.

A hobgoblin's eyes are yellowish or dark brown. Hobgoblins keep their weapons keenly polished and in good repair.//Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate Elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents. Hobgoblin deities reinforce this militaristic outlook, and their Clerics are able to favor additional weapons as a result, such as the Spear, BattleAxe and Longsword.//While not as mechanically-minded as normal goblins, a hobgoblin is still very alert, noticing secret doors as well as an Elf. Like most dark-dwelling races, a hobgoblin has Darkvision out to 60'.

They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds prefer to ambush and set up traps.//A kobold may become any class, excluding the combination classes. Kobolds are masters of trapworks and are otherwise very mechanically inclined. They notice secret doors as well as an Elf and traps as well as a Dwarf. Kobolds have Darkvision out to 90'.

Adult males can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds and are always very strong. Lizardmen are largely indifferent to other races, being primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but sound tactics.//Lizaard men generally prefer professions associated with nature or survival. Lizardmen have trouble relating to most other races.//Lizardmen are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn, or 60 rounds). Lizardmen can bite for 1d4 pounds + Strength modifier in damage, but must forgo any weapon attacks that round. A lizardman fighter can specialize in their own bite.

Their hair and beards may be blond, brown, black, or sometimes red. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. The most noticeable features about a gnome from the standpoint of other races is their pointed ears and noses. They are renowned for their rapidly-changing moods, sometimes gruff and contrary, sometimes whimsical and humorous. They have a lifespan between two and three centuries long.//Gnomes are frail like elves, unable to roll higher than d6 for hit dice regardless of class. They are also small like halflings, unable to wield large weapons and needing to wield medium weapons in two hands. With respect to encumbrance, gnomes are equivalent to halflings.//Gnomes have the ability to see invisible creatures and objects within 30 feet. Such creatures and objects appear as strange magical glows in the shape of the creature or object. A Thief hiding in shadows, an invisible sprite, or a character wearing an elven cloak may all be detected in this way.
