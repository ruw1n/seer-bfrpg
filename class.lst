desc=Clerics are those who have devoted themselves to the service of a deity, pantheon or other belief system. Most clerics spend their time in mundane forms of service such as preaching and ministering in a temple, but there are those who are called to go abroad from the temple and serve their deity in a more direct way, smiting undead monsters and aiding in the battle against evil and chaos. Player character Clerics are assumed to be among the latter group.//Clerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as Fighters. They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief would deftly avoid. Clerics can cast spells of divine nature, and they have the power to `!turn` the Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of faith alone.//The Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Cleric. They may wear any armor, but may only use bludgeoning weapons (specifically including warhammer, mace, maul, club, quarterstaff, and sling).

desc=Druids are nature priests, revering the gods of the natural world. Often a Druid uses mistletoe as a holy symbol, but this can vary with specific nature deities. Druids spend their time contemplating nature or in mundane forms of service such as ministering in rural areas. However, there are those who are called to go abroad to serve the natural order in a more direct way by working actively to restore balance.//Druids advance at the same rate as Clerics, and they use the same combat and saving throw tables. Druids can cast spells of divine nature, and they have the power of Animal Affinity (`!calm`), working much like the Clerical ability to Turn Undead. They can identify any natural animal or plant, and can identify clean water.//The Prime Requisite for Druid is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Druid. Druids may not utilize metal armor of any type, and they are likewise limited to wooden shields. Druids utilize any one-handed melee weapon, as well as the quarterstaff, sling, and crossbow.

desc=Fighters include soldiers, guardsmen, adventuring warriors, and anyone else for whom fighting is a way of life. They train in combat, and they generally approach problems head-on, weapon in hand.//Not surprisingly, Fighters are the best at fighting of all the classes. They are also among the hardiest, able to take more punishment than the likes of Clerics or Thieves. Although they are not skilled in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor. Fighters have the ability to automatically perform a called shot on an enemy if you exceed their AC by 4 or more when attacking with their chosen weapon (`!spec`). Called shots can be trips, disarms, pushes, taunts, rallies, cleaves, or anything else you can think of! The weapon a Fighter specializes in gains additional bonuses to accuracy and damage as he or she levels up, as well as the ability to attack twice per round.//The Prime Requisite for Fighters is Strength; a character must have a Strength score of 9 or higher to become a Fighter. Members of this class may wear any armor and use any weapon.

desc=Barbarians are warriors born in savage lands, far from the mollifying comforts of civilization. Barbarians rely on hardiness, stealth, and foolhardy bravery to beat their enemies. Barbarians do not surprise as easily, and cannot be harmed by Thief's sneak attack, Scout's sniper shot or Assassin's death strike unless the thief/scout/assassin is of a higher level than the Barbarian. Barbarians gain additional Armor Class when fighting Unarmored, which rises with level gained, and deal twice strength damage when attacking with melee weapons. Barbarians may also add `rage` to their melee attacks, which gives an additional +2 to accuracy and damage, but reduces the Barbarian's AC by 2 until the start of his or her next turn. Barbarians also move 5 additional feet per round.//In order to qualify to be a Barbarian, a character requires a Strength of 9 or higher, a Dexterity of 9 or higher, and a Constitution of 9 or higher.//Barbarians may use leather armor, but no heavy armor, and may wield any weapon.

desc=Paladins are divine warriors who fight in service of their deity or religious organization. To become a Paladin, a character must have at least a Strength of 9, a Wisdom of 11, and a Charisma of 11. There are no racial restrictions for the Paladin. Paladins may use any weapon and wear any armor or shield.//There are no alignments in Basic Fantasy RPG, but a Paladin must still obey a code of honor, as defined by the GM, and must try to perform duties assigned by his or her deity or religious hierarchy. If the Paladin breaks the code, all powers granted are taken away, and the character must atone for his or her actions as soon as possible. Until the Paladin successfully atones, he or she is considered an ordinary Fighter.//Paladins gain clerical spellcasting, but only starting at level 10 - until then, they may use cantrips. Paladins may also `!turn` like a cleric, though their level is considered half that of a cleric's.//Paladins radiate a constant ProtectionFromEvil (or ProtectionFromGood) aura in a 10' radius. The Paladin can also DetectEvil (or DetectGood), at will, as the spell.//Once per day, the paladin can Lay on Hands (`!loh`) to any wounded character and heal 2 points of damage, plus the Paladin's Charisma modifier. On each odd-numbered level (3rd, 5th, etc) the Paladin may do this one additional time per day (so, twice at 3rd level, three times per day at 5th level, etc.) Starting at 7th level, the Paladin may choose to cure disease (as the spell) instead of providing healing as above. At 11th level, the Paladin may also use lay on hands to neutralize poison.//Once per day, per level, a Paladin can make his or her non-magical weapon into a magic weapon for purposes of hitting creatures only able to be struck with a silver or magical weapon. This effect lasts for 1 turn (60 rounds.)

desc=Rangers are specialized warriors who roam the borderlands, where their mission is to keep the beasts and monsters of the untamed lands at bay. They generally operate alone or in small groups, and rely on stealth and surprise to meet their objectives.//To become a Ranger, a character must have a Strength score of 9 or higher, a Wisdom of 11 or higher, and a Dexterity of 11 or higher. They may use any weapon and may wear up to Leather armor. Humans, Elves, Halflings, Half-Elves and Half-Orcs may become Rangers.//Rangers can Move Silently and Hide like a Thief, and can also Track by following a trail. When tracking, the Ranger must roll once per hour traveled or lose the trail.//A Ranger must declare a favored enemy. Against this favored enemy, the Ranger gets a bonus of +3 to damage (``fav``). This enemy might be a certain category of creature such as giants, humanoids, dragons, or undead. With the GM's permission, the list might include rival organizations, nations, or similar agencies.//Rangers are always expert bowmen. When using any regular bow (shortbow or longbow, but not crossbow), a Ranger adds +2 to his or her Attack Bonus. At 9th level, the Ranger may fire two arrows every round.

desc=Magic-Users are those who seek and use knowledge of the arcane. They do magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater power, but rather through insight and understanding.//Magic-Users are the worst of all classes at fighting; hours spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but quickly falling behind.//The Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are the Dagger and the Club (most walking sticks qualify as clubs). Magic-Users may not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things interfere with spellcasting.//A first level Magic-User begins play knowing ReadMagic and one other first-level spell of their choice.

Though "normal" Magic-Users can create illusions, those created by an Illusionist are superior in quality and realism. The Prime Requisite for an Illusionist is Intelligence. The Illusionist is required to have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher. Illusionists are poor fighters, with fighting ability equivalent to Magic-Users. Likewise they may not wear any armor of any sort or use shields, and may only use a Dagger or Club to attack with.//Because of their expertise at creating and understanding illusions, Illusionists always gain an additional +2 on saves vs. any sort of illusion or phantasm, including disbelieving an illusion.

desc=Necromancers are Magic-Users who practice necromancy, seeking expertise of the darker side of the arcane. Necromancers are rare due to the unsavory nature of their profession, often living in proximity to graveyards, burial mounds, and other places associated with the dead. Regardless of what they are called or the culture they come from, they share certain traits.//Necromancers are poor fighters, with fighting ability equivalent to Magic-Users. Likewise they may not wear any armor of any sort or use shields, and may only use a Dagger or Club to attack with.//The Prime Requisite for Necromancers is Intelligence. In addition to requiring an Intelligence score of 11 or higher, a Necromancer must also have a Wisdom score of at least 9 in order to qualify for the rigors of this class.//Necromancers produce magic much like other types of Magic-Users, but have different spell choices. They can learn spells from one another so long as the spells are available to both classes. Like other Magic-Users, a first-level Necromancer begins play knowing ReadMagic and one other spell of his or her choice.

desc=Spellcrafters are a special kind of Magic-User, known for their mastery over magic items and constructs. They use the same experience and spell progression as Magic-Users, and have the same hit dice, attack bonus, saving throws, and restrictions on armor and weapons. Spellcrafters should be treated as a Magic-Users for all purposes, except as noted below.//The Prime Requisite for Spellcrafters is Intelligence; a character must have an Intelligence score of 12 or higher to become a Spellcrafter.//A first-level Spellcrafter begins play knowing ReadMagic and one other spell of first level. These spells are written in a spellbook provided by their master. Spellcrafters do the same "kind" of magic as normal Magic-Users, such that they are able to learn spells from each other, as long as the same spell is on both classes' spell list.//Spellcrafters receive a bonus of +1 to all saving throws made against effects generated by magic items, including magical traps. Those who are targets of magical effects generated by a magic item operated by a Spellcrafter suffer a penalty of -1 on any saving throw against it.//The real power of Spellcrafters is their greater understanding of the processes of magical fabrication. Spellcrafters can create any scroll starting at 1st level, potions and other single use items beginning at 3rd level, and at 7th level they can create any kind of magic item. A Spellcrafter receives a +25 percent bonus to all magical research rolls for creating magical items.//At 6th level, Spellcrafters become so adept as to cut in half the time necessary to create a magic item. At 9th level, Spellcrafters reduce the cost of creating a magic item by 25 percent.

desc=Thieves are those who take what they want or need by stealth, disarming traps and picking locks to get to the gold they crave; or "borrowing" money from pockets, beltpouches, etc. right under the nose of the mark without the victim ever knowing.//Thieves fight better than Magic-Users but not as well as Fighters. Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead at higher levels.//The Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief. They may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however.//Thieves have a number of special abilities, described on their `!stats` menu. One turn (ten minutes) must usually be spent to use any of these abilities, as determined by the GM. The GM may choose to call upon a player character to make any of these rolls. Also note that the GM may apply situational adjustments as they see fit; for instance, it's obviously harder to climb a wall that is slick rather than one that is dry.//Thieves can perform a Sneak Attack any time they are behind an opponent in melee and it is likely the opponent doesn't know the Thief is there. The GM may require a `movesilently` or `hide` roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack is made with `sneak` at the end of the attack roll, and adds +4 to the attack bonus, as well as doing double damage if the attack is successful. A Thief usually cannot make a Sneak Attack on the same opponent twice in any given combat. The Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not missile) weapon.

desc=Scouts specialize in stealth operations in the wilderness. They are similar to Rangers in some ways, having similar functions and abilities. Scouts have the same attack bonus and saving throws as Thieves of the same level. They have been toughened by self-sufficiency and isolation from the supplies and comforts of civilized lands, and therefore use a d6 for hit dice. It also takes more training to be a Scout, and therefore Scouts advance at the same rate as Clerics. Scouts should be treated as Thieves for all purposes, except as described herein.//To become a Scout, a character must have both a Wisdom and Dexterity score of 9 or higher. As with the Thief, a Scout may not wear metal armor, nor may they use shields of any sort. They may use any weapon. Any race may be a Scout.//Scouts are able to detect traps at an improved rate (`!trap`), but unlike Thieves they do not have the ability to remove them. However, their ability to detect traps applies equally well to snares and pits in the wilderness as well as the more common form of dungeon or fortress traps.//Unlike a Thief, a Scout gains no special bonuses for making sneak attacks in melee, though normal bonuses for attacking from behind or with surprise are applied.//Scouts are always experts at ranged weapons. When using any ranged weapon, a Scout adds +1 to all attack rolls, and may ``snipe`` to do double damage if attacking an opponent unawares (determined by the GM). At 9th level a Scout's ability with ranged weapons becomes so great that he or she no longer suffers a penalty for attacking at long range.

desc=There are those who make their living dealing death from the shadows. These people are called assassins. Most are trained by secret guilds or societies; civilized lands generally forbid and destroy such organizations.//Assassins must abide by the same weapon and armor restrictions as Thieves, and use the same attack bonuses and saving throws. A prospective Assassin must have a minimum Dexterity and Intelligence of 9 each. Only humans may become Assassins.//Assassins have several special abilities, as listed on the table below. Some abilities are shared with the Thief class, though the Poison ability is useful for making lethal poisons.//Assassinate: This is the Assassin's primary special ability. As with the Thief's sneak attack ability, any time an assassin is behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn't know they are there, an attempt to assassinate must be made. The attack must be carried out with a one-handed melee weapon. The attack (rolled with ``kill`` added) is rolled an attack bonus of +4, and if the attack hits, the victim must roll a saving throw vs. Death Ray or be instantly killed. If this saving throw is a success, the victim still suffers the weapon's normal damage. Characters two or more levels lower than the Assassin (or monsters with HD two or more less than the Assassin's level) are denied a saving throw.

desc=Members of this powerful class that combines stealth and illusion may cast spells while wearing leather armor. These characters roll four-sided dice for hit points.

[Accuracy]
desc=Accuracy is the Scout class's specialty with ranged weapons. When using any ranged weapon, a Scout adds +1 to all attack rolls automatically.

[TurnUndead]
desc=TurnUndead is a class ability shared by Clerics and Paladins, which allows them to send undead creatures fleeing in terror. It is used by `!turn`, ex. `!turn zo1 zo2 sk1 sk2 sk3`. Turn Undead has no range limit, but the undead must be within the cleric or paladin's line of sight.//A cleric is twice as effective at turning undead as a paladin; paladins are treated as 1/2 their level when determining the power of the ability. Turn Undead becomes more powerful as the character levels up, working on stronger undead creatures.

[AnimalAffinity]
desc=AnimalAffinity is the Druid class ability to calm and/or befriend animals. This is done with `!calm`, ex. `!calm wo1 wo2 wo3`. Add the `-tame` flag if the animals themselves are already tame, or `-monstrous` if the animal is actually a magical beast, such as a griffin, pegasus, or chimera. The bot will state whether the animal is calmed or befriended. If the druid wishes to recruit a calmed creature, perhaps a spell might assist. If the party attacks a calmed creature, it is no longer calmed.

[WeaponSpec]
desc=WeaponSpec is the Fighter class ability to specialize in their weapon of choice. This is done with `!spec (weapon)`, ex. `!spec longsword`. Specializing in a weapon will impart bonuses onto all weapons of that type, so specializing in longsword will mean your normal longsword as well as your magic flaming longsword are equally effective in your hands. Specializing in a weapon gives bonuses to attack and damage rolls, as well as multiple attacks, based on the fighter's level, as follows://`L1-3:  +1/+0   (1 attack)`//`L4-6:  +1/+1   (1 attack)`//`L7-9:  +2/+1   (1 attack)`//`L10-12:+2/+2   (2 attacks)`//`L13-15:+3/+2   (2 attacks)`//`L16-18:+3/+3   (2 attacks)`//`L19-20:+4/+3   (3 attacks)`//Fighters also gain the ability called "Heroic Called Shot" with their specialized weapon. Any class may use called shots with `!a (weapon) (target) called`: if the called shot hits, the target may make a save vs. Death Ray. On a failure, the called shot succeeds. A called shot can be anything like a trip, disarm, push, blind, frighten, etc. The GM will work out the bonuses according to their ruling. Fighters, however, get to perform called shots automatically, on top of dealing damage: if their attack roll exceeds the target's AC by 4, a called shot attempt is automatically rolled.

[NoSneak]
desc=NoSneak is the Barbarian class ability to ignore a Thief's sneak attack, a Scout's snipe, or an Assassin's death strike, unless the Thief/Scout/Assassin is higher level than the Barbarian.

[AnimalReflexes]
desc=AnimalReflexes is the Barbarian class ability to be surprised less often. Barbarians are only surprised by a 1 on the 1d6.

[Runner]
desc=Runner is the Barbarian class ability that gives them a movement speed boost of 5 feet, factored in automatically.

[Rage]
desc=Rage is the Barbarian class ability to swing wildly, adding +2 to both attack and damage rolls, but reducing the Barbarian's AC by 2 until the start of their next turn. In this bot, rage is not a state one enters, but rather a powerful burst of rage in that moment. To use rage with one's attack, simply add `rage` to the end of the attack command, ex. `!a greataxe or1 rage`.

[Might]
desc=Might is the Barbarian class ability that adds 2 times strength modifier to all melee weapon attacks, factored in automatically.

[UnarmoredDefense]
desc=UnarmoredDefense is the Barbarian class ability that gives ascending AC when the barbarian is wearing no armor, based on level. At first level, Leather Armor will be better than the unarmored defense, but that quickly changes. Barbarian unarmored AC is as follows://`Level 1:  12 AC`//`Level 2:  13 AC`//`Level 3:  14 AC`//`Level 4:  16 AC`//`Level 5:  17 AC`//`Level 6:  18 AC`//`Level 7+: 20 AC`

[MagicWeapon]
desc=MagicWeapon is the Paladin class ability to transform a mundane weapon into a magical weapon, for the purpose of overcoming nonmagical resistance or immunity. This is done with `!magicweapon`, ex. `!magicweapon longsword`. A paladin can only make their own equipped weapon magical, not someone else's. A paladin may do this on the same turn as attacking, but may only bless one weapon per combat round. A weapon stays blessed (magical) for a full turn (60 combat rounds). This ability may be used indefinitely.

[LayonHands]
desc=LayonHands is the Paladin class ability to impart divine healing by pressing the palms of both hands onto one's own body, or an ally's body, and offering prayer. The divine healing is equal to 2 + Charisma modifier. Keep in mind Paladin spellcasting is keyed off of Wisdom. To use, `!loh` (for self) or `!loh (target)` on an ally.//At level 7, paladins can cure diseases with lay on hands, to do so would be `!loh (target) disease`. At level 11, paladins can neutralize poison in much the same way: `!loh (target) poison`.//Paladins have 1 use of this ability per day at level 1, 2 at level 3, 3 at level 5, 4 at level 7, and so on.

[ProtectionAura]
desc=Paladins radiate a constant ProtectionFromEvil (or ProtectionFromGood) aura in a 10' radius. This is handled manually, as in there is no automation in the bot for it. Against summoned evil/good creatures, extraplanar evil/good creatures, or creatures with sufficiently evil/good intent (determined by the GM), the paladin and those within their aura receive a bonus of +2 to AC and saving throws, and are immune to being charmed by the target. Summoned and extraplanar creatures matching the "protection from" classification are also completely unable to physically touch the paladin and those within their aura.//The Paladin can also DetectEvil (or DetectGood), at will, as the spell. This is done with `!cast detectevil -i`. Keep in mind that a paladin chooses whether to protect from/detect evil or good once, upon character creation, and this cannot change without the GM's permission: you do not get access to both DetectEvil and DetectGood.

[FavoredEnemy]
desc=FavoredEnemy is the Ranger class ability that adds a bonus of +3 to damage rolls against their favored enemy type. This enemy might be a certain category of creature such as giants, humanoids, dragons, or undead. With the GM's permission, the list might include rival organizations, nations, or similar agencies. To use, simply add `fav` to the end of an attack command, such as `!a longbow go1 fav`.

[BowExpert]
desc=BowExpert is the Ranger specialty with shortbows and longbows: all rangers automatically add +2 to attack rolls performed with these weapons. This ability also allows rangers to fire 2 shots per turn with these weapons, starting at level 9.

[SneakAttack]
desc=SneakAttack is the Thief ability to deal double damage on an unaware opponent. Sneak attacks are **melee only**, and cannot be performed with ranged weapons: if you want to sneak attack from range, consider a Scout.//In order to use, simply add `sneak` to the end of an attack roll when the GM determines your attack qualifies for sneak attack. This adds +4 to the attack roll as well as doubling the damage. This double damage can stack with a spear's charge and a critical hit.//You may only attempt a sneak attack on a given monster once per combat, barring special GM permission.

[SniperShot]
desc=SniperShot is the Scout ability to deal double damage on an unaware opponent. Snipes are **ranged only**, and cannot be performed with melee weapons: if you want to sneak attack from melee, consider a Thief.//In order to use, simply add `snipe` to the end of an attack roll when the GM determines your attack qualifies for a snipe. Ex: `!a heavyxbow go1 snipe`.//You may only attempt a sniper shot on a given monster once per combat, barring special GM permission.

[Sharpshooter]
desc=Sharpshooter is the Scout ability to ignore the penalty for attacking at a weapon's long range. This is unlocked at level 9.

[DeathStrike]
desc=DeathStrike is the Assassin class ability to instantly kill an opponent with a fatal blow. In order to use, the Assassin must be approaching the target unawares, such as from behind when they are distracted by an ally, or after successfully hiding or moving silently. Death strikes are **melee only**, and also must be used with a one-handed weapon; you may death strike with a longsword, but not a greatsword.//In order to use, simply add `kill` to the end of an attack roll, ex. `!a dagger go1 kill`. This adds +4 to the attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target must save vs. Death or die instantly. Even if the target passes the save, this attack deals normal damage. Characters two or more levels lower than the Assassin (or monsters with HD two or more less than the Assassin's level) are denied a saving throw.//You may only attempt a death strike on a given monster once per combat, barring special GM permission.
