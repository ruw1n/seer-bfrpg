desc=Crossbows are essentially short, heavy laths of wood or metal set across a stock or tiller. Much of the popularity of the crossbow comes from its ease in use - and much shorter training time for men-at-arms compared to bows. The mechanical lock & pulling mechanisms means higher tensions can be drawn and held without tiring the archer. This allows for greater ranges than a regular bow, at the expense of a slower rate of fire. Light crossbows are hand- or lever-drawn.

med=160

type=piercing

desc=Crossbows are essentially short, heavy laths of wood or metal set across a stock or tiller. Much of the popularity of the crossbow comes from its ease in use - and much shorter training time for men-at-arms compared to bows. The mechanical lock & pulling mechanisms means higher tensions can be drawn and held without tiring the archer. This allows for greater ranges than a regular bow, at the expense of a slower rate of fire. Heavy crossbows usually require composite or steel laths, and are often mechanically drawn, though some may use a braced draw, holding the bow with a stirrup and using the arms and legs to draw the string back.

med=30

type=fire
stat=dex
desc=A flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like missile. The oil must be set afire in order to inflict damage; otherwise the oil is just slipepry. Assuming some means of igniting the oil is at hand, a direct hit to a creature deals 1d8 points of fire damage, plus in the next round the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage. If the oil is ignited by some sort of wick or fuse, then all other creatures within 5 feet of the point of impact receive 1d6 points of fire damage from the splash. A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid this damage.//A flask of oil spilled or splattered on the ground will burn for 10 rounds. Those attempting to cross the burning oil will receive 1d6 points of damage each round they are in it (with no saving throw in this case).

In addition, each additional undead monster within 5 feet of the point of impact receives 1d6 points of damage from the splash. Holy water is only effective for one round.

The snake may be recalled by the user at any point, in which case it returns to their hand and returns to staff form. It also returns in this way when the duration expires, or if the save is made. The snake has Armor Class 15, moves 20' per round and has 20 hit points; any hit points of damage taken are healed completely when the snake returns to staff form; if killed in snake form, the magic is destroyed and it turns into a broken stick.

desc=This device is a bag which appears to be about 2 feet wide and 4 feet deep. It opens into an extradimensional space, and is able to hold more than should be possible: up to 500 pounds of weight, and up to 70 cubic feet of volume. Any object to be stored in the bag must fit through the opening, which has a circumference of 4 feet.//Puncturing or tearing the bag will destroy its magic and cause all contents to be lost forever. If this item is turned inside out all contents are dumped. The bag is unharmed, but it will no longer work until it is turned right side out again. If living creatures are placed inside they will suffocate within a turn (with exceptions for creatures resistance to suffocation as determined by the GM). The bag's volume cannot be overfilled (as excess items simply cannot be put inside), but if overloaded above 500 pounds and then lifted it will be torn.//Getting any particular item from the bag requires the bearer to spend a round searching during which no movement can be made.

[BootsofTravelingandLeaping]
weight=1
type=rare

[BroomofFlying]
weight=0.5
type=rare
cat=manual
desc=This broom is able to fly through the air for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed of 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as they have a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when the command word is spoken.

[EfreetiBottle]
weight=0.2
type=rare
cat=manual
desc=This item may appear as an ornate bottle, or sometimes as a magic lamp. It can be activated once per day, by opening it if it takes the form of a bottle or by rubbing it if it takes the form of a lamp. When activated, smoke pours out and forms into anf efreeti.//The efreeti released was trapped in the bottle and forced to serve whoever activates it. However, an efreeti who has spent too long in a bottle may have lost its mind, and if this happens the efreeti will begin a frenzied attack upon whoever activated the bottle, disappearing when either the user of the bottle or the efreeti is dead. There is, fortunately, only a 1 in 10 chance this will happen.//On the other hand, there is also a 1 in 10 chance that the efreeti of the bottle is able to grant three **wishes** to the user. If this is the case, the efreeti will perform no other service, and cannot return to the bottle after it is activated until the user makes a wish. Subsequent wishes require additional activations, and upon the final wish being granted the efreeti disappears for good.//Roll 1d10 when the bottle is first activated; on a roll of 1, the efreeti is insane, while on a roll of 10 the efreeti has three wishes to grant. If neither of these results is rolled, the efreeti will serve the user for up to one hour per day for 101 days, after which time it is freed and will disappear. Note that after the first activation, every day that passes is counted toward the 101 days whether or not the user activates the bottle.

[FlyingCarpet]

A flying carpet can fly at any speed up to its maximum, and can hover on command.

[MirrorofImprisonment]
weight=3
type=rare
cat=manual
desc=This item can appear as any style of full-length or larger mirror. It is a form of magical trap, which can be set or deactivated by speaking a command word followed by "activate" or "deactivate".//When in its active state, any character or creature who stands within 30 feet of the mirror and sees its reflection must save vs. Spells or be drawn bodily into the mirror, including all items worn or carried. The victim is placed within one of the 20 metaphysical cells inside the mirror. Those trapped in the mirror are mere reflections and are unable to take any action. The last character who spoke the command word to the mirror is immune to its power, as are undead, constructs, and any creature that lacks eyes.//A character who speaks the command word and then calls the number of a cell will cause the reflection of the occupant of that cell to appear in the mirror. The trapped creature can move and speak, but cannot cast spells or take any other real action. The controlling character may interrogate the trapped victim if desired, though the mirror does not compel the victim to respond or to be truthful. The controller may at any time speak the command word again and say "return" and the victim will be returned to its cell; or, the controller can say the command word followed by "come out" to free the victim, who appears standing beside the controller.//Should all cells be full when a creature is drawn inside, one cell chosen at random will be emptied with the freed creature appearing where the trapped one had been standing. The freed creature is safe from the mirror for one turn (60 rounds) thereafter before it can again be trapped. All victims will be freed instantly if the mirror is broken.

[RopeofClimbing]
weight=5
type=rare
cat=manual
desc=This 50 foot long rope is about one half inch in diameter, but is capable of supporting up to 3,000 pounds if tied to a secure anchor point. When the user holds one end of the rope and speaks the command word, the rope animates, moving like a snake at a rate of 10' per round in whatever direction the user commands. The rope is even able to move into a completely vertical position if so ordered. It can be commanded to tie itself to any anchor point within reach (since the user must continue holding one end of the rope, it can reach no more than 50 feet from that point). The rope has no real strength and thus cannot lift or support any weight if not tied to an anchor point.
