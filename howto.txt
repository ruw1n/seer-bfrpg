Seer (BFRPG) — Player & GM Guide
================================

This guide explains how to use the Seer Discord bot for Basic Fantasy RPG. It’s organized for quick reference, with concise “how to” steps for players and a toolbox section for GMs.

Conventions & Tips
------------------
• Commands begin with `!`. Examples: `!char Steve`, `!a longsword`, `!cast sleep -i`  
• Names are case‑insensitive and support partial matches where noted.  
• An “ACTIVE character” means the one you selected with `!char`.  
• Many commands require your .coe character file to exist (created via `!charcreate`).  
• GM‑only commands require an active battle channel / initiative where applicable.  
• Some commands accept `-dm` or `-private` to DM you instead of posting publicly, and `-p` or `-public` to force public posts.

Crafting System (Players & GM)
------------------------------
What you can craft
  • Scrolls, potions, wands, staves, and magic gear per BFRPG norms (plus custom recipes baked into the bot).  
  • Some items are single‑use and support batching doses; others track charges.

Listing & starting projects
  • `!craft list [<filter>] [-p N]` – browse craftables (paged)
  • `!craft start "<RecipeName>" [-doses N] [-safe]` – start a project
  • `-safe` mode: +25% success chance, but ×2 time and ×2 cost
  • Many recipes allow parameters; examples are shown in the list UI

Tracking & resolving
  • `!craft status` – see your current projects and timers  
  • `!craft due` – list projects ready to resolve  
  • `!craft resolve [<project-id>|all]` – roll completion & apply results  
  • `!craft cancel <project-id>` – cancel a project (lose materials)  
  • `!craftdump` – (GM/dev) export a simplified JSON catalog for review

Costs, time, and success (rules of thumb)
  • Base chance is derived from the recipe / spell level.  
  • Single‑use items may use an “equivalent level” to compute time/cost.  
  • Weapons/armor use an “effective bonus” formula to scale complexity.  
  • Class usability: adding `any_class` on an effect costs +1000 gp per effect.  
  • “Safe” crafting: +25% success, but double time and double cost.  
  • Spellcrafter class perks (if your class qualifies):
      – +25% base success chance (class feature)  
      – Half time at level 6+  
      – −25% cost at level 9+  

Strongholds (Players & GM)
--------------------------
Followers & establishment
  • `!followers <PC>` – rolls randomized followers by class family when a PC builds a class‑appropriate stronghold or temple.  
  • Results include counts by type and quick build notes to seed roleplay.

Stronghold calculator
  • `!shcalc <width> <length> <floors> [--wall <wood|softstone|hardstone|hewn|dressed>] [-thickness <ft>] [-moat] [-keep] [-gatehouse] [-towers N] [-rooms N] [-materials-only]`  
  • Outputs costs, man‑hours, timelines, and a breakdown of materials vs. labor.  
  • Use `-materials-only` if you just want the shopping list.

Digging / excavation
  • `!shdig <earth|softstone|hardstone> <cubic-yards> [-crew N] [-workdays N]`  
  • Gives realistic excavation days based on material hardness and crew size.

NPCs & Parties (GM)
-------------------
• `!npcparty` – Generate modular monster‑style human parties (templates in /monsters), then spawn with `!mon` to populate encounters or factions.  
• Use `!e town` for quick RP prompts and NPC hooks; `!e <terrain>` for wilderness; `!e dungeon <avgLvl>` for traditional wandering checks.  
• `!react` and `!morale` integrate with your spawned monsters for social and combat flow.

GM Toolbox (At a Glance)
------------------------
• Start/supervise battle: `!init`, `!list`, `!status`, `!track`, `!remove`, `!end`  
• Spawn monsters: `!mon`, adjust: `!hd`, clear: `!ds`, set flags: `!status`  
• Damage/heal: `!damage`, `!heal`, rouse KO: `!rouse`  
• Crowd control & hazards: `!breath`, `!spray`, `!spore`, `!stench`, `!spin`, `!thunderclap`, `!gaze`, `!slow`, `!ward`, `!dance`, `!charm`, `!goo`, `!invis`, `!unpoly`, `!ignite`  
• Saves & checks for monsters: `!msave`, `!morale`, `!react`, `!surprise`  
• Treasure & bookkeeping: `!lair`, `!treasure`, `!tally`, `!loot`  
• Admin/Owner: `!zap` is server‑owner only (dangerous; use with caution).

Appendix: Useful Patterns
-------------------------
• Target by name (partial ok): `!a spear go1` or `!spin AI1 go1 go2`  
• Private vs public posts: many exploration commands support `-dm` or `-private` to DM you instead of posting publicly; use `-p` or `-public` to force public.  
• When in doubt: `!help <command>` shows detailed usage.
